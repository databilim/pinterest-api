When he succeeded to the post the title was changed from High Commissioner to Lord High Commissioner -  a change typical of the man, cynically aware of the bedazzling effect of rank and title on those, in any population, who prefer prestigious subjection to the responsibilities of self-rule.\n\nHere is a list of High Commissioners\n\nSir James Campbell 1814\u20131816 (actually a military governor)\nSir Thomas Maitland (1759\u20131824) 1815\u20131823\nSir Frederick Adam (1781\u20131853) 1823\u20131832\nSir Alexander Woodford (1782\u20131870) 1832\u20131832\nGeorge Nugent-Grenville, 2nd Baron Nugent (1788\u20131850) 1832\u20131835\nHoward Douglas (1776\u20131861) 1835\u20131840\nJames Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie (1784\u20131843) 1840\u20131843\nJohn Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton (1778\u20131863) 1843\u20131849\nSir Henry George Ward (1797\u20131860) 1849\u20131855\nSir John Young (1807\u20131876) 1855\u20131859\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone (1809\u20131898) 1859\u20131859\nSir Henry Knight Storks (1811\u20131874) 1859\u20131863\nCount Dimitrios Nikolaou Karousos, President of Parliament (1799\u20131873) 1863\u20131864\n\nThe Ionian Islands were never British Colonies. Although, checking in Colonial Office records, I read that Gladstone noted, when he visited the islands in 1858-59, that Sir Thomas Maitland had so designed their constitution in 1817 that the Protectorate was a colony in all but name.  'Tom' Maitland saw things that way and took steps to bring it about, so that although Ionians, jostled by Turkey, Russia and Austria, had initially welcomed British 'protection', all but those benefitting from Maitland's calculating patronage, became frustrated, affronted and in some cases enraged at the misappropriation of their hopes for freedom and indeoendence at the hands of a self-aggrandizing bully, \n\nI  read this letter of his in the archives Kew:\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sibadd\/3585403622\/\">www.flickr.com\/photos\/sibadd\/3585403622\/<\/a>\n\nThe promise of equal rights is not inconsistent with Maitland's aristocratic view of English subjects, that Ionians should get 'the same treatment' as their British equivalent.\n\nYears after Maitland's death, the idea that Corfu and Paxos should be partitioned from the remaining Ionian Islands and made British Colonies was secretly proposed by another Lord High Commissioner, Sir John Young, in 1858. The secret was leaked to The Times and quickly spread through the Ionian press, so that Gladstone had to emphasise this was Young's idea not British policy.\n\nTo make sense of the history of this period, especially the process by which the Ionian Islands, on 21 May 1864, became united with the independent Greek Kingdom,  it helps to know the policies, personalities and styles of the British High Commissioners based on Corfu at the Palace of St Michael and St George, a palace built in grandiose style by Sir Thomas Maitland. A man with the poorest opinion of the Ionian population, Maitland disliked foreigners, and ruled what was intended to be an emerging democracy using practices normal in his own country - nepotism, favouritism and cynical cultivation of placemen. He loathed and despised both Hellenic and British radicals. He had experienced humiliating defeat at the hands of Toussaint L'ouverture when fighting for British interests, especially those of slave owners, in the West Indies. Arrogant, rude, mean-minded, given to petty jealousies, ever recalling and seeking revenge for slights, he represents, to this day, a typical type of 'ugly Englishman' - detested as much by his own countrymen as by foreigners. The Greeks, no less capable of deploying such vices, helped confirm his prejudices, while slowly and but relentlessly 'a few good men' - British, Ionian and Hellenic - learned how to play and defeat him at his own intrigues. One of his actions I'd like to explain was the sacking of the Ionian road builder, the Swiss engineer De Bosset. This tale should be told lest the building of the Ionian road network - an excellent project - be credited to Maitland  rather than recorded as something that happened despite him as a result of the endeavours of hard working professionals.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.archive.org\/stream\/sirthomasmaitlan00lordrich\/sirthomasmaitlan00lordrich_djvu.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.archive.org\/stream\/sirthomasmaitlan00lordrich\/sirthom...<\/a>\n\nUnfortunately there was much stronger direct evidence that Maitland meant to drive De Bosset out of Corfu. De Bosset reported himself to the Lord High Commissioner, and was immediately invited to dinner, and afterwards, on the 6th of February 1817, to a ball. In the ball-room Maitland pointedly and deliberately approached the colonel; and the other guests fell away out of respect and left His Excellency and his victim face to face, with no one  within earshot. \nHence we have only De Bosset's word for what followed. But there are such volumes of evidence on the whole case, and De Bosset's word was so continually and fully substantiated, that we cannot avoid noticing his account of this short interview, and indeed it is only too likely a story. \n\n&quot;Colonel De Bosset,'&quot; said the great man, &quot;I am very glad to welcome you to Corfu, and to say that I think you had much better go away. You have many enemies here, and you would do better if you went away as soon as possible.&quot; The unhappy man could only stammer incoherently in reply to so fierce an assault ; whereupon Maitland, smilingly and ingratiatingly, with every possible mark of affectionate attention, repeated his menace. De Bosset could only bow, and leave the ball. Next morning he called on the military secretary and asked what it all meant.  After so broad a hint, he said, there was nothing to do except to go. Perhaps the Lord High Commissioner had some plan to that end that he might fall in with. But Hankey would not help him. &quot;There was nothing in it all&quot; he said; everybody had noticed how drunk His Excellency was, no doubt he had forgotten all about it by now. But no man in De Bosset's position could rest satisfied with such an answer. &quot;It may be,&quot; he replied, &quot;that His Excellency was drunk, although personally I cannot think it. His speech was quite plain, startlingly plain, and no drunken man could so command his features as to threaten me with ruin while apparently he was overwhelming me with compliments.&quot;\nBut Hankey stood by his chief. Sir Thomas was drunk, and there was an end of it. &quot;Granted, then,&quot; said De Bosset, &quot;since you will have it, that His Excellency was drunk, there still remains a proverb that you will be acquainted with, and that I take \nleave to remind you of, in vino veritas : and there is the question to which I have received no answer \u2014 How am I to go away?&quot;  It is to be presumed that the military secretary had his cue, for he would say nothing. It was not Maitland's intention that De \nBosset should be honourably retired; he meant to expel him ignominiously. When this had been achieved, and the quarrel thus artistically rounded off, the unhappy man made his way to England and waited on the Duke of York. &quot;Nobody,&quot; said His \nRoyal Highness, &quot;could take away an officer's commission except His Majesty, and the colonel might rely upon his assurance as commander-in-chief that this would not be done without the fullest investigation.&quot; (De Bosset recovered his reputation in the end and Maitland was discredited but the Ionians lost a road builder)\n\nMaitland was succeeded by a very different man - Sir Frederick Adam - who fought at Waterloo, had good manners, decent taste, loved and married a Greek, and tried to begin to repair the damage done to British-Ionian relations by his unpleasant predecessor.\n\nMore thoughts on my blog at:\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/democracystreet.blogspot.com\/2009\/06\/id-been-told-by-british-friend-some.html\"

You boys should write a book.   \n******************************************************************************\n\nMarch 3 is Hina Matsuri (Doll Festival or Girls' Festival), when people pray for the happiness and healthy growth of girls. Families with young daughters mark this day by setting up a display of dolls inside the house. They offer rice crackers and other food to the dolls.\n\nThe dolls wear costumes of the imperial court during the Heian period (794-1192) and are placed on a tiered platform covered with red felt. The size of the dolls and number of steps vary, but usually the displays are of five or seven layers; single-tiered decorations with one male and one female doll are also common.\n\nThe top tier is reserved for the emperor and the empress. A miniature gilded folding screen is placed behind them, just like the real Imperial throne of the ancient court.\n\nThe practice of displaying these dolls on the third day of the third month on the traditional Japanese calendar began during the Edo period (1603-1868). It started as a way of warding off evil spirits, with the dolls acting as a charm. Even today, people in some parts of the country release paper dolls into rivers after the festival, praying that the dolls take people's place in carrying away sickness and bad fortune.\n\nMost families take their beautiful collection of dolls out of the closet around mid-February and put it away again as soon as Hina Matsuri is over. This is because of an old superstition that families that are slow in putting back the dolls have trouble marrying off their daughters.\n"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"JennFL2","count_faves":"1","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_t.jpg","height_t":74,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_m.jpg","height_s":177,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_n.jpg","height_n":235,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a.jpg","height_m":368,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_z.jpg","height_z":471,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_c.jpg","height_c":588,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7499\/26606825770_6bf9a00d1a_b.jpg","height_l":753,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"jennfl"},{"id":"34073915693","owner":"122972896@N06","secret":"c8394bd02b","server":"4198","farm":5,"title":"CRW_6847","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"Maitland Rd.

Add to this a plaque to Constable Walker, who shot and killed Thunderbolt, and it is clear that much of the local tourism is focussed around this &quot;gentleman&quot; bushranger.\nWard was born at Windsor in 1835. He was working as a drover and horse-breaker on the Paterson River when he was arrested for receiving 75 horses and sentenced to ten years hard labour on 13 August, 1856. He was sent to the gaol on Cockatoo Island in Sydney Harbour and was released from there in 1860 but in 1861 he was captured and sentenced again for horse theft. On 11 September, 1863 he escaped from Cockatoo Island and fled towards Bourke where his wife and two children were living. For the next six and a half years he robbed mail coaches, as well as roadside inns, stores and private homes from Maitland to the Queensland border and west to Bourke. At times he worked with accomplices but, because of the great advantage of his superior skills as a horseman, he often worked alone. By 1870 there was a reward of \u00a3550 for him.\nHis exploits included the attempted robbery of the Merton Mail and Tollhouse at Lochinvar in 1863; the robbery of race patrons and publicans and the Campbell Hill Toll Gate at Rutherford; from 1865 to 1870 his spate of robberies (86 in total) in the western district, the northwest slopes and plains the upper Hunter and the country towards the Queensland border are well covered in Court documents. Thunderbolt acquired a reputation as a gentleman. It was said he was always polite, particularly to women, and he never killed anybody. He was also very sensible. He never attempted to rob a place where the police were located and he avoided armed coaches. Consequently his reputation was more connected with his bravery and his skill as a horseman than with his violence.\nInfo source:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.aussietowns.com.au\/town\/uralla-nsw\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.aussietowns.com.au\/town\/uralla-nsw<\/a>"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Paul Leader - Paulie's Time Off Photography","count_faves":"4","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":75,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":180,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":240,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":375,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":480,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":600,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4852\/45175384235_b12f6f2ff9_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":768,"pathalias":"bypaulleader"},{"id":"6166338714","owner":"40687512@N06","secret":"48d01ecc34","server":"6151","farm":7,"title":"Canada Army Run 2011: local results, photos (Part D)","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":0,"license":"1","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"For the half-marathon (21.1 km) results, here are the local (Ottawa &amp; area) participants -- sorted by cities and first name -- in the September 18, 2011, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.armyrun.ca\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canada Army Run<\/a> held in Ottawa, Ontario.

Doel, Sr","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"DOEL, JOHN, brewer, businessman, and politician; b. in 1790 in Wiltshire, Eng.; d. in Toronto, Ont., 9 Feb. 1871.\n\nJohn Doel emigrated about 1817 to Philadelphia, where he may have become a bookseller. He had married Hannah Huntly in England three years earlier, and they were to have five children. The family arrived in York, Upper Canada, on 5 Nov. 1818. For a time Doel was employed to deliver uncalled-for letters but he soon established a brewery at the rear of his home. This, along with profitable investments in real estate, provided him with a comfortable living.\n\nA radical Reformer in politics, Doel was a critic of Sir Peregrine Maitland*\u2019s administration of 1818\u201328 and in 1828 was a supporter of Judge John Walpole Willis in the controversy surrounding him. St Andrew\u2019s ward elected him in 1834 to the Toronto City Council, where he voted for William Lyon Mackenzie* as mayor; he was reelected in 1835. Doel refused to sign the council\u2019s complimentary address presented to Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne* when Colborne retired the next year, and he did sign a sarcastic protest delivered to Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head in 1836 after the latter had replied in an insulting manner to an address from the House of Assembly.\n\nDoel was a close associate of Mackenzie. When the latter needed to borrow from the Bank of the People to sustain his second newspaper, the Constitution, Doel endorsed one of his notes and subsequently lent him other sums. On the eve of the rebellion, the Reformers held several important meetings at Doel\u2019s home and at his brewery. There he signed the declaration of the Toronto Reformers drawn up on 28 July 1837, and moved the resolution that Reformers refrain from the consumption of dutiable imports so as to diminish the government\u2019s revenue. He was a member of the vigilance committee named on 31 July. It is usually stated that when, in October, Mackenzie presented his plans for seizing the lieutenant governor and establishing a provisional government, Doel would not assent to them and took no part in the uprising. There is some evidence, however, that Mackenzie\u2019s supporters in Toronto used Doel\u2019s brewery as a gathering place as late as 5 December. Doel was arrested three times, and on each occasion imprisoned for several days; his home was subjected to repeated searches and soldiers were billeted with the family.\n\nAfter Mackenzie\u2019s flight from the province, Doel had to make good on his note held by the Bank of the People. Mackenzie\u2019s property was attainted, but the crown permitted his creditors to make good their claims against him. In 1839 James Lesslie*, on behalf of himself and other creditors, obtained a judgement in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench against Mackenzie. In 1845, after the crown granted Mackenzie\u2019s lands to Lesslie in trust to sell so that the proceeds could liquidate the judgement, Doel bought Mackenzie\u2019s two town lots in Dundas and his lot in Garafraxa Township (now East and West Garafraxa) for \u00a381. When Mackenzie returned to Canada in 1850, Doel sold him the property back for \u00a3200. This was a generous settlement, being less than the total sum Doel had spent for the property, interest, and taxes, as well as the original loan and the debts to other creditors of Mackenzie which he had paid. Doel indeed accepted \u00a350 in cash and a note on the balance. He thus helped Mackenzie meet the property qualifications for a member of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nDoel remained a Reformer after the rebellion although he did not take an active part in politics. He did, however, sign the resolutions critical of Sir Charles Metcalfe*\u2019s administration drawn up by the Reform Association of Canada in 1844. He continued to operate his brewery until it was burned on 11 April 1847. He had been a member of the first Methodist Episcopal church erected in York in 1818, and he was a trustee of the Toronto General Hospital. When he died in 1871 his funeral was attended in a body by the York Pioneer Society of which he had been a member."},"rotation":90,"ownername":"Toronto Cemetery Walker","realname":"Shannon Stafford","count_faves":"0","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":56,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":135,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":180,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":281,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":360,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":450,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5711\/30213278863_4f648b8ed0_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":576,"pathalias":null},{"id":"30811864876","owner":"142205655@N06","secret":"4872d3fb76","server":"5705","farm":6,"title":"John Doel, Sr","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"DOEL, JOHN, brewer, businessman, and politician; b. in 1790 in Wiltshire, Eng.; d. in Toronto, Ont., 9 Feb. 1871.\n\nJohn Doel emigrated about 1817 to Philadelphia, where he may have become a bookseller.

There he signed the declaration of the Toronto Reformers drawn up on 28 July 1837, and moved the resolution that Reformers refrain from the consumption of dutiable imports so as to diminish the government\u2019s revenue. He was a member of the vigilance committee named on 31 July. It is usually stated that when, in October, Mackenzie presented his plans for seizing the lieutenant governor and establishing a provisional government, Doel would not assent to them and took no part in the uprising. There is some evidence, however, that Mackenzie\u2019s supporters in Toronto used Doel\u2019s brewery as a gathering place as late as 5 December. Doel was arrested three times, and on each occasion imprisoned for several days; his home was subjected to repeated searches and soldiers were billeted with the family.\n\nAfter Mackenzie\u2019s flight from the province, Doel had to make good on his note held by the Bank of the People. Mackenzie\u2019s property was attainted, but the crown permitted his creditors to make good their claims against him. In 1839 James Lesslie*, on behalf of himself and other creditors, obtained a judgement in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench against Mackenzie. In 1845, after the crown granted Mackenzie\u2019s lands to Lesslie in trust to sell so that the proceeds could liquidate the judgement, Doel bought Mackenzie\u2019s two town lots in Dundas and his lot in Garafraxa Township (now East and West Garafraxa) for \u00a381. When Mackenzie returned to Canada in 1850, Doel sold him the property back for \u00a3200. This was a generous settlement, being less than the total sum Doel had spent for the property, interest, and taxes, as well as the original loan and the debts to other creditors of Mackenzie which he had paid. Doel indeed accepted \u00a350 in cash and a note on the balance. He thus helped Mackenzie meet the property qualifications for a member of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nDoel remained a Reformer after the rebellion although he did not take an active part in politics. He did, however, sign the resolutions critical of Sir Charles Metcalfe*\u2019s administration drawn up by the Reform Association of Canada in 1844. He continued to operate his brewery until it was burned on 11 April 1847. He had been a member of the first Methodist Episcopal church erected in York in 1818, and he was a trustee of the Toronto General Hospital. When he died in 1871 his funeral was attended in a body by the York Pioneer Society of which he had been a member."},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Toronto Cemetery Walker","realname":"Shannon Stafford","count_faves":"0","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_t.jpg","height_t":56,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_m.jpg","height_s":135,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_n.jpg","height_n":180,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76.jpg","height_m":281,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_z.jpg","height_z":360,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_c.jpg","height_c":450,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5705\/30811864876_4872d3fb76_b.jpg","height_l":576,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":null},{"id":"28384209372","owner":"142205655@N06","secret":"b5df9f3eaa","server":"8716","farm":9,"title":"John Doel","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"DOEL, JOHN, brewer, businessman, and politician; b. in 1790 in Wiltshire, Eng.; d. in Toronto, Ont., 9 Feb. 1871.\n\nJohn Doel emigrated about 1817 to Philadelphia, where he may have become a bookseller. He had married Hannah Huntly in England three years earlier, and they were to have five children. The family arrived in York, Upper Canada, on 5 Nov. 1818. For a time Doel was employed to deliver uncalled-for letters but he soon established a brewery at the rear of his home. This, along with profitable investments in real estate, provided him with a comfortable living.\n\nA radical Reformer in politics, Doel was a critic of Sir Peregrine Maitland's administration of 1818\u201328 and in 1828 was a supporter of Judge John Walpole Willis in the controversy surrounding him. St Andrew's ward elected him in 1834 to the Toronto City Council, where he voted for William Lyon Mackenzie as mayor; he was reelected in 1835. Doel refused to sign the council's complimentary address presented to Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne when Colborne retired the next year, and he did sign a sarcastic protest delivered to Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head in 1836 after the latter had replied in an insulting manner to an address from the House of Assembly.\n\nDoel was a close associate of Mackenzie.

It is located on Holborn Viaduct, almost opposite the Old Bailey. In medieval times it stood just outside (&quot;without&quot;) the now-demolished old city wall, near the Newgate. It has been a living of St John's College, Oxford, since 1622.\n\nThe original Saxon church on the site was dedicated to St Edmund the King and Martyr. During the Crusades in the 12th century the church was renamed St Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, in reference to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The name eventually became contracted to St Sepulchre.\n\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the City. It was completely rebuilt in the 15th century but was gutted by the Great Fire of London in 1666,[1] which left only the outer walls, the tower and the porch standing[2] -. Modified in the 18th century, the church underwent extensive restoration in 1878. It narrowly avoided destruction in the Second World War, although the 18th-century watch-house in its churchyard (erected to deter grave-robbers) was completely destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a coffered ceiling[3] installed in 1834. The Vicars' old residence has recently been renovated into a modern living quarter.\n\nDuring the reign of Mary I in 1555, St Sepulchre's vicar, John Rogers, was burned as a heretic.\n\nSt Sepulchre is named in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons as the &quot;bells of Old Bailey&quot;. Traditionally, the great bell would be rung to mark the execution of a prisoner at the nearby gallows at Newgate. The clerk of St Sepulchre's was also responsible for ringing a handbell outside the condemned man's cell in Newgate Prison to inform him of his impending execution. This handbell, known as the Execution Bell, now resides in a glass case to the south of the nave.\n\nThe church has been the official musicians' church for many years and is associated with many famous musicians. Its north aisle (formerly a chapel dedicated to Stephen Harding) is dedicated as the Musicians' Chapel, with four windows commemorating John Ireland, the singer Dame Nellie Melba, Walter Carroll and the conductor Sir Henry Wood respectively.[4] Wood, who &quot;at the age of fourteen, learned to play the organ&quot; at this church [1] and later became its organist, also has his ashes buried in this church.\n\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.[5] The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the City of London Rifles (the 6th Battalion London Regiment). The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate<\/a>\n\nThe Early History of St. Sepulchre's\u2014Its Destruction in 1666\u2014The Exterior and Interior\u2014The Early Popularity of the Church\u2014Interments here\u2014Roger Ascham, the Author of the &quot;Schoolmaster&quot;\u2014Captain John Smith, and his Romantic Adventures\u2014Saved by an Indian Girl\u2014 St. Sepulchre's Churchyard\u2014Accommodation for a Murderess\u2014The Martyr Rogers\u2014An Odd Circumstance\u2014Good Company for the Dead\u2014A Leap from the Tower\u2014A Warning Bell and a Last Admonition\u2014Nosegays for the Condemned\u2014The Route to the Gallows-tree\u2014 The Deeds of the Charitable\u2014The &quot;Saracen's Head&quot;\u2014Description by Dickens\u2014Giltspur Street\u2014Giltspur Street Compter\u2014A Disreputable Condition\u2014Pie Corner\u2014Hosier Lane\u2014A Spurious Relic\u2014The Conduit on Snow Hill\u2014A Ladies' Charity School\u2014Turnagain Lane\u2014Poor Betty!\u2014A Schoolmistress Censured\u2014Skinner Street\u2014Unpropitious Fortune\u2014William Godwin\u2014An Original Married Life.\n\nMany interesting associations\u2014Principally, however, connected with the annals of crime and the execution of the laws of England\u2014belong to the Church of St. Sepulchre, or St. 'Pulchre. This sacred edifice\u2014anciently known as St. Sepulchre's in the Bailey, or by Chamberlain Gate (now Newgate)\u2014stands at the eastern end of the slight acclivity of Snow Hill, and between Smithfield and the Old Bailey. The genuine materials for its early history are scanty enough. It was probably founded about the commencement of the twelfth century, but of the exact date and circumstances of its origin there is no record whatever. Its name is derived from the Holy Sepulchre of our Saviour at Jerusalem, to the memory of which it was first dedicated.\n\nThe earliest authentic notice of the church, according to Maitland, is of the year 1178, at which date it was given by Roger, Bishop of Sarum, to the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew. These held the right of advowson until the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., and from that time until 1610 it remained in the hands of the Crown. James I., however, then granted &quot;the rectory and its appurtenances, with the advowson of the vicarage,&quot; to Francis Phillips and others. The next stage in its history is that the rectory was purchased by the parishioners, to be held in fee-farm of the Crown, and the advowson was obtained by the President and Fellows of St. John the Baptist College, at Oxford.\n\nThe church was rebuilt about the middle of the fifteenth century, when one of the Popham family, who had been Chancellor of Normandy and Treasurer of the King's Household, with distinguished liberality erected a handsome chapel on the south side of the choir, and the very beautiful porch still remaining at the south-west corner of the building. &quot;His image,&quot; Stow says, &quot;fair graven in stone, was fixed over the said porch.&quot;\n\nThe dreadful fire of 1666 almost destroyed St. Sepulchre's, but the parishioners set energetically to work, and it was &quot;rebuilt and beautified both within and without.&quot; The general reparation was under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, and nothing but the walls of the old building, and these not entirely, were suffered to remain. The work was done rapidly, and the whole was completed within four years.\n\n&quot;The tower,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;retained its original aspect, and the body of the church, after its restoration, presented a series of windows between buttresses, with pointed heads filled with tracery, crowned by a string-course and battlements. In this form it remained till the year 1790, when it appears the whole fabric was found to be in a state of great decay, and it was resolved to repair it throughout. Accordingly the walls of the church were cased with Portland stone, and all the windows were taken out and replaced by others with plain semi-circular heads, as now seen\u2014certainly agreeing but badly with the tower and porch of the building, but according with the then prevailing spirit of economy. The battlements, too, were taken down, and a plain stone parapet was substituted, so that at this time (with the exception of the roof, which was wagon-headed, and presented on the outside an unsightly swell, visible above the parapet) the church assumed its present appearance.&quot; The ungainly roof was removed, and an entirely new one erected, about 1836.\n\nAt each corner of the tower\u2014&quot;one of the most ancient,&quot; says the author of &quot;Londinium Redivivum,&quot; &quot;in the outline of the circuit of London&quot; \u2014there are spires, and on the spires there are weathercocks. These have been made use of by Howell to point a moral: &quot;Unreasonable people,&quot; says he, &quot;are as hard to reconcile as the vanes of St. Sepulchre's tower, which never look all four upon one point of the heavens.&quot; Nothing can be said with certainty as to the date of the tower, but it is not without the bounds of probability that it formed part of the original building. The belfry is reached by a small winding staircase in the south-west angle, and a similar staircase in an opposite angle leads to the summit. The spires at the corners, and some of the tower windows, have very recently undergone several alterations, which have added much to the picturesqueness and beauty of the church.\n\nThe chief entrance to St. Sepulchre's is by a porch of singular beauty, projecting from the south side of the tower, at the western end of the church. The groining of the ceiling of this porch, it has been pointed out, takes an almost unique form; the ribs are carved in bold relief, and the bosses at the intersections represent angels' heads, shields, roses, &amp;c., in great variety.\n\nComing now to the interior of the church, we find it divided into three aisles, by two ranges of Tuscan columns. The aisles are of unequal widths, that in the centre being the widest, that to the south the narrowest. Semi-circular arches connect the columns on either side, springing directly from their capitals, without the interposition of an entablature, and support a large dental cornice, extending round the church. The ceiling of the middle aisle is divided into seven compartments, by horizontal bands, the middle compartment being formed into a small dome.\n\nThe aisles have groined ceilings, ornamented at the angles with doves, &amp;c., and beneath every division of the groining are small windows, to admit light to the galleries. Over each of the aisles there is a gallery, very clumsily introduced, which dates from the time when the church was built by Wren, and extends the whole length, excepting at the chancel. The front of the gallery, which is of oak, is described by Mr. Godwin as carved into scrolls, branches, &amp;c., in the centre panel, on either side, with the initials &quot;C. R.,&quot; enriched with carvings of laurel, which have, however, he says, &quot;but little merit.&quot;\n\nAt the east end of the church there are three semicircular-headed windows. Beneath the centre one is a large Corinthian altar-piece of oak, displaying columns, entablatures, &amp;c., elaborately carved and gilded.\n\nThe length of the church, exclusive of the ambulatory, is said to be 126 feet, the breadth 68 feet, and the height of the tower 140 feet.\n\nA singularly ugly sounding-board, extending over the preacher, used to stand at the back of the pulpit, at the east end of the church. It was in the shape of a large parabolic reflector, about twelve feet in diameter, and was composed of ribs of mahogany.\n\nAt the west end of the church there is a large organ, said to be the oldest and one of the finest in London. It was built in 1677, and has been greatly enlarged. Its reed-stops (hautboy, clarinet, &amp;c.) are supposed to be unrivalled. In Newcourt's time the church was taken notice of as &quot;remarkable for possessing an exceedingly fine organ, and the playing is thought so beautiful, that large congregations are attracted, though some of the parishioners object to the mode of performing divine service.&quot;\n\nOn the north side of the church, Mr. Godwin mentions, is a large apartment known as &quot;St. Stephen's Chapel.&quot; This building evidently formed a somewhat important part of the old church, and was probably appropriated to the votaries of the saint whose name it bears.\n\nBetween the exterior and the interior of the church there is little harmony. &quot;For example,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;the columns which form the south aisle face, in some instances, the centre of the large windows which occur in the external wall of the church, and in others the centre of the piers, indifferently.&quot; This discordance may likely enough have arisen from the fact that when the church was rebuilt, or rather restored, after the Great Fire, the works were done without much attention from Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nSt. Sepulchre's appears to have enjoyed considerable popularity from the earliest period of its history, if one is to judge from the various sums left by well-disposed persons for the support of certain fraternities founded in the church\u2014namely, those of St. Katherine, St. Michael, St. Anne, and Our Lady\u2014and by others, for the maintenance of chantry priests to celebrate masses at stated intervals for the good of their souls. One of the fraternities just named\u2014that of St. Katherine\u2014 originated, according to Stow, in the devotion of some poor persons in the parish, and was in honour of the conception of the Virgin Mary. They met in the church on the day of the Conception, and there had the mass of the day, and offered to the same, and provided a certain chaplain daily to celebrate divine service, and to set up wax lights before the image belonging to the fraternity, on all festival days.\n\nThe most famous of all who have been interred in St. Sepulchre's is Roger Ascham, the author of the &quot;Schoolmaster,&quot; and the instructor of Queen Elizabeth in Greek and Latin. This learned old worthy was born in 1515, near Northallerton, in Yorkshire. He was educated at Cambridge University, and in time rose to be the university orator, being notably zealous in promoting what was then a novelty in England\u2014the study of the Greek language. To divert himself after the fatigue of severe study, he used to devote himself to archery. This drew down upon him the censure of the all-work-and-no-play school; and in defence of himself, Ascham, in 1545, published &quot;Toxophilus,&quot; a treatise on his favourite sport. This book is even yet well worthy of perusal, for its enthusiasm, and for its curious descriptions of the personal appearance and manners of the principal persons whom the author had seen and conversed with. Henry VIII. rewarded him with a pension of \u00a310 per annum, a considerable sum in those days. In 1548, Ascham, on the death of William Grindall, who had been his pupil, was appointed instructor in the learned languages to Lady Elizabeth, afterwards the good Queen Bess. At the end of two years he had some dispute with, or took a disgust at, Lady Elizabeth's attendants, resigned his situation, and returned to his college. Soon after this he was employed as secretary to the English ambassador at the court of Charles V. of Germany, and remained abroad till the death of Edward VI. During his absence he had been appointed Latin secretary to King Edward. Strangely enough, though Queen Mary and her ministers were Papists, and Ascham a Protestant, he was retained in his office of Latin secretary, his pension was increased to \u00a320, and he was allowed to retain his fellowship and his situation as university orator. In 1554 he married a lady of good family, by whom he had a considerable fortune, and of whom, in writing to a friend, he gives, as might perhaps be expected, an excellent character. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, she not only required his services as Latin secretary, but as her instructor in Greek, and he resided at Court during the remainder of his life. He died in consequence of his endeavours to complete a Latin poem which he intended to present to the queen on the New Year's Day of 1569. He breathed his last two days before 1568 ran out, and was interred, according to his own directions, in the most private manner, in St. Sepulchre's Church, his funeral sermon being preached by Dr. Andrew Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's. He was universally lamented; and even the queen herself not only showed great concern, but was pleased to say that she would rather have lost ten thousand pounds than her tutor Ascham, which, from that somewhat closehanded sovereign, was truly an expression of high regard.\n\nAscham, like most men, had his little weaknesses. He had too great a propensity to dice and cock-fighting. Bishop Nicholson would try to convince us that this is an unfounded calumny, but, as it is mentioned by Camden, and other contemporary writers, it seems impossible to deny it. He died, from all accounts, in indifferent circumstances. &quot;Whether,&quot; says Dr. Johnson, referring to this, &quot;Ascham was poor by his own fault, or the fault of others, cannot now be decided; but it is certain that many have been rich with less merit. His philological learning would have gained him honour in any country; and among us it may justly call for that reverence which all nations owe to those who first rouse them from ignorance, and kindle among them the light of literature.&quot; His most valuable work, &quot;The Schoolmaster,&quot; was published by his widow. The nature of this celebrated performance may be gathered from the title: &quot;The Schoolmaster; or a plain and perfite way of teaching children to understand, write, and speak the Latin tongue. \u2026 And commodious also for all such as have forgot the Latin tongue, and would by themselves, without a schoolmaster, in short time, and with small pains, recover a sufficient habilitie to understand, write, and speak Latin: by Roger Ascham, ann. 1570. At London, printed by John Daye, dwelling over Aldersgate,&quot; a printer, by the way, already mentioned by us a few chapters back (see page 208), as having printed several noted works of the sixteenth century.\n\nDr. Johnson remarks that the instruction recommended in &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot; is perhaps the best ever given for the study of languages.\n\nHere also lies buried Captain John Smith, a conspicuous soldier of fortune, whose romantic adventures and daring exploits have rarely been surpassed. He died on the 21st of June, 1631. This valiant captain was born at Willoughby, in the county of Lincoln, and helped by his doings to enliven the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. He had a share in the wars of Hungary in 1602, and in three single combats overcame three Turks, and cut off their heads. For this, and other equally brave deeds, Sigismund, Duke of Transylvania, gave him his picture set in gold, with a pension of three hundred ducats; and allowed him to bear three Turks' heads proper as his shield of arms. He afterwards went to America, where he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Indians. He escaped from them, however, at last, and resumed his brilliant career by hazarding his life in naval engagements with pirates and Spanish men-of-war. The most important act of his life was the share he had in civilising the natives of New England, and reducing that province to obedience to Great Britain. In connection with his tomb in St. Sepulchre's, he is mentioned by Stow, in his &quot;Survey,&quot; as &quot;some time Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New England.&quot;\n\nCertainly the most interesting events of his chequered career were his capture by the Indians, and the saving of his life by the Indian girl Pocahontas, a story of adventure that charms as often as it is told. Bancroft, the historian of the United States, relates how, during the early settlement of Virginia, Smith left the infant colony on an exploring expedition, and not only ascended the river Chickahominy, but struck into the interior. His companions disobeyed his instructions, and being surprised by the Indians, were put to death. Smith preserved his own life by calmness and self-possession. Displaying a pocket-compass, he amused the savages by an explanation of its power, and increased their admiration of his superior genius by imparting to them some vague conceptions of the form of the earth, and the nature of the planetary system. To the Indians, who retained him as their prisoner, his captivity was a more strange event than anything of which the traditions of their tribes preserved the memory. He was allowed to send a letter to the fort at Jamestown, and the savage wonder was increased, for he seemed by some magic to endow the paper with the gift of intelligence. It was evident that their captive was a being of a high order, and then the question arose, Was his nature beneficent, or was he to be dreaded as a dangerous enemy? Their minds were bewildered, and the decision of his fate was referred to the chief Powhatan, and before Powhatan Smith was brought. &quot;The fears of the feeble aborigines,&quot; says Bancroft, &quot;were about to prevail, and his immediate death, already repeatedly threatened and repeatedly delayed, would have been inevitable, but for the timely intercession of Pocahontas, a girl twelve years old, the daughter of Powhatan, whose confiding fondness Smith had easily won, and who firmly clung to his neck, as his head was bowed down to receive the stroke of the tomahawks. His fearlessness, and her entreaties, persuaded the council to spare the agreeable stranger, who could make hatchets for her father, and rattles and strings of beads for herself, the favourite child. The barbarians, whose decision had long been held in suspense by the mysterious awe which Smith had inspired, now resolved to receive him as a friend, and to make him a partner of their councils. They tempted him to join their bands, and lend assistance in an attack upon the white men at Jamestown; and when his decision of character succeeded in changing the current of their thoughts, they dismissed him with mutual promises of friendship and benevolence. Thus the captivity of Smith did itself become a benefit to the colony; for he had not only observed with care the country between the James and the Potomac, and had gained some knowledge of the language and manners of the natives, but he now established a peaceful intercourse between the English and the tribes of Powhatan.&quot;\n\nOn the monument erected to Smith in St. Sepulchre's Church, the following quaint lines were formerly inscribed:\u2014\n\n&quot;Here lies one conquered that hath conquered kings,\nSubdued large territories, and done things\nWhich to the world impossible would seem,\nBut that the truth is held in more esteem.\nShall I report his former service done,\nIn honour of his God, and Christendom?\nHow that he did divide, from pagans three,\nTheir heads and lives, types of his chivalry?\u2014\nFor which great service, in that climate done,\nBrave Sigismundus, King of Hungarion,\nDid give him, as a coat of arms, to wear\nThese conquered heads, got by his sword and spear.\nOr shall I tell of his adventures since\nDone in Virginia, that large continent?\nHow that he subdued kings unto his yoke,\nAnd made those heathens flee, as wind doth smoke;\nAnd made their land, being so large a station,\nAn habitation for our Christian nation,\nWhere God is glorified, their wants supplied;\nWhich else for necessaries, must have died.\nBut what avails his conquests, now he lies\nInterred in earth, a prey to worms and flies?\nOh! may his soul in sweet Elysium sleep,\nUntil the Keeper, that all souls doth keep,\nReturn to judgment; and that after thence\nWith angels he may have his recompense.&quot;\n\nSir Robert Peake, the engraver, also found a last resting-place here. He is known as the master of William Faithorne\u2014the famous English engraver of the seventeenth century\u2014and governor of Basing House for the king during the Civil War under Charles I. He died in 1667. Here also was interred the body of Dr. Bell, grandfather of the originator of a well-known system of education.\n\n&quot;The churchyard of St. Sepulchre's,&quot; we learn from Maitland, &quot;at one time extended so far into the street on the south side of the church, as to render the passage-way dangerously narrow. In 1760 the churchyard was, in consequence, levelled, and thrown open to the public. But this led to much inconvenience, and it was re-enclosed in 1802.&quot;\n\nSarah Malcolm, the murderess, was buried in the churchyard of St. Sepulchre's in 1733. This coldhearted and keen-eyed monster in human form has had her story told by us already. The parishioners seem, on this occasion, to have had no such scruples as had been exhibited by their predecessors a hundred and fifty years previous at the burial of Awfield, a traitor. We shall see presently that in those more remote days they were desirous of having at least respectable company for their deceased relatives and friends in the churchyard.\n\n&quot;For a long period,&quot; says Mr. Godwin (1838), &quot;the church was surrounded by low mean buildings, by which its general appearance was hidden; but these having been cleared away, and the neighbourhood made considerably more open, St. Sepulchre's now forms a somewhat pleasing object, notwithstanding that the tower and a part of the porch are so entirely dissimilar in style to the remainder of the building.&quot; And since Godwin's writing the surroundings of the church have been so improved that perhaps few buildings in the metropolis stand more prominently before the public eye.\n\nIn the glorious roll of martyrs who have suffered at the stake for their religious principles, a vicar of St. Sepulchre's, the Reverend John Rogers, occupies a conspicuous place. He was the first who was burned in the reign of the Bloody Mary. This eminent person had at one time been chaplain to the English merchants at Antwerp, and while residing in that city had aided Tindal and Coverdale in their great work of translating the Bible. He married a German lady of good position, by whom he had a large family, and was enabled, by means of her relations, to reside in peace and safety in Germany. It appeared to be his duty, however, to return to England, and there publicly profess and advocate his religious convictions, even at the risk of death. He crossed the sea; he took his place in the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross; he preached a fearless and animated sermon, reminding his astonished audience of the pure and wholesome doctrine which had been promulgated from that pulpit in the days of the good King Edward, and solemnly warning them against the pestilent idolatry and superstition of these new times. It was his last sermon. He was apprehended, tried, condemned, and burned at Smithfield. We described, when speaking of Smithfield, the manner in which he met his fate.\n\nConnected with the martyrdom of Rogers an odd circumstance is quoted in the &quot;Churches of London.&quot; It is stated that when the bishops had resolved to put to death Joan Bocher, a friend came to Rogers and earnestly entreated his influence that the poor woman's life might be spared, and other means taken to prevent the spread of her heterodox doctrines. Rogers, however, contended that she should be executed; and his friend then begged him to choose some other kind of death, which should be more agreeable to the gentleness and mercy prescribed in the gospel. &quot;No,&quot; replied Rogers, &quot;burning alive is not a cruel death, but easy enough.&quot; His friend hearing these words, expressive of so little regard for the sufferings of a fellow-creature, answered him with great vehemence, at the same time striking Rogers' hand, &quot;Well, it may perhaps so happen that you yourself shall have your hands full of this mild burning.&quot; There is no record of Rogers among the papers belonging to St. Sepulchre's, but this may easily be accounted for by the fact that at the Great Fire of 1666 nearly all the registers and archives were destroyed.\n\nA noteworthy incident in the history of St. Sepulchre's was connected with the execution, in 1585, of Awfield, for &quot;sparcinge abrood certen lewed, sedicious, and traytorous bookes.&quot; &quot;When he was executed,&quot; says Fleetwood, the Recorder, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, July 7th of that year, &quot;his body was brought unto St. Pulcher's to be buryed, but the parishioners would not suffer a traytor's corpse to be laid in the earth where their parents, wives, children, kindred, masters, and old neighbours did rest; and so his carcass was returned to the burial-ground near Tyburn, and there I leave it.&quot;\n\nAnother event in the history of the church is a tale of suicide. On the 10th of April, 1600, a man named William Dorrington threw himself from the roof of the tower, leaving there a prayer for forgiveness.\n\nWe come now to speak of the connection of St. Sepulchre's with the neighbouring prison of Newgate. Being the nearest church to the prison, that connection naturally was intimate. Its clock served to give the time to the hangman when there was an execution in the Old Bailey, and many a poor wretch's last moments must it have regulated.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the altar a board with a list of charitable donations and gifts used to contain the following item:\u2014&quot;1605. Mr. Robert Dowe gave, for ringing the greatest bell in this church on the day the condemned prisoners are executed, and for other services, for ever, concerning such condemned prisoners, for which services the sexton is paid \u00a316s. 8d.\u2014\u00a350.\n\nIt was formerly the practice for the clerk or bellman of St. Sepulchre's to go under Newgate, on the night preceding the execution of a criminal, ring his bell, and repeat the following wholesome advice:\u2014\n\n&quot;All you that in the condemned hold do lie,\nPrepare you, for to-morrow you shall die;\nWatch all, and pray, the hour is drawing near\nThat you before the Almighty must appear;\nExamine well yourselves, in time repent,\nThat you may not to eternal flames be sent.\nAnd when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,\nThe Lord above have mercy on your souls.\nPast twelve o'clock!&quot;\n\nThis practice is explained by a passage in Munday's edition of Stow, in which it is told that a Mr. John Dowe, citizen and merchant taylor of London, gave \u00a350 to the parish church of St. Sepulchre's, under the following conditions:\u2014After the several sessions of London, on the night before the execution of such as were condemned to death, the clerk of the church was to go in the night-time, and also early in the morning, to the window of the prison in which they were lying. He was there to ring &quot;certain tolls with a hand-bell&quot; appointed for the purpose, and was afterwards, in a most Christian manner, to put them in mind of their present condition and approaching end, and to exhort them to be prepared, as they ought to be, to die. When they were in the cart, and brought before the walls of the church, the clerk was to stand there ready with the same bell, and, after certain tolls, rehearse a prayer, desiring all the people there present to pray for the unfortunate criminals. The beadle, also, of Merchant Taylors' Hall was allowed an &quot;honest stipend&quot; to see that this ceremony was regularly performed.\n\nThe affecting admonition\u2014&quot;affectingly good,&quot; Pennant calls it\u2014addressed to the prisoners in Newgate, on the night before execution, ran as follows:\u2014\n\n&quot;You prisoners that are within,\nWho, for wickedness and sin,\n\nafter many mercies shown you, are now appointed to die to-morrow in the forenoon; give ear and understand that, to-morrow morning, the greatest bell of St. Sepulchre's shall toll for you, in form and manner of a passing-bell, as used to be tolled for those that are at the point of death; to the end that all godly people, hearing that bell, and knowing it is for your going to your deaths, may be stirred up heartily to pray to God to bestow his grace and mercy upon you, whilst you live. I beseech you, for Jesus Christ's sake, to keep this night in watching and prayer, to the salvation of your own souls while there is yet time and place for mercy; as knowing to-morrow you must appear before the judgment-seat of your Creator, there to give an account of all things done in this life, and to suffer eternal torments for your sins committed against Him, unless, upon your hearty and unfeigned repentance, you find mercy through the merits, death, and passion of your only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return to Him.&quot;\n\nAnd the following was the admonition to condemned criminals, as they were passing by St. Sepulchre's Church wall to execution:\u2014&quot; All good people, pray heartily unto God for these poor sinners, who are now going to their death, for whom this great bell doth toll.\n\n&quot;You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask mercy of the Lord, for the salvation of your own souls, through the [merits, death, and passion of Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto Him.\n\n&quot;Lord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.\nLord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.&quot;\n\nThe charitable Mr. Dowe, who took such interest in the last moments of the occupants of the condemned cell, was buried in the church of St. Botolph, Aldgate.\n\nAnother curious custom observed at St. Sepulchre's was the presentation of a nosegay to every criminal on his way to execution at Tyburn. No doubt the practice had its origin in some kindly feeling for the poor unfortunates who were so soon to bid farewell to all the beauties of earth. One of the last who received a nosegay from the steps of St. Sepulchre's was &quot;Sixteen-string Jack,&quot; alias John Rann, who was hanged, in 1774, for robbing the Rev. Dr. Bell of his watch and eighteen pence in money, in Gunnersbury Lane, on the road to Brentford. Sixteen-string Jack wore the flowers in his button-hole as he rode dolefully to the gallows. This was witnessed by John Thomas Smith, who thus describes the scene in his admirable anecdotebook, &quot;Nollekens and his Times:&quot;\u2014&quot; I remember well, when I was in my eighth year, Mr. Nollekens calling at my father's house, in Great Portland Street, and taking us to Oxford Street, to see the notorious Jack Rann, commonly called Sixteenstring Jack, go to Tyburn to be hanged. \u2026 The criminal was dressed in a pea-green coat, with an immense nosegay in the button-hole, which had been presented to him at St. Sepulchre's steps; and his nankeen small-clothes, we were told, were tied at each knee with sixteen strings. After he had passed, and Mr. Nollekens was leading me home by the hand, I recollect his stooping down to me and observing, in a low tone of voice, 'Tom, now, my little man, if my father-in-law, Mr. Justice Welch, had been high constable, we could have walked by the side of the cart all the way to Tyburn.'&quot;\n\nWhen criminals were conveyed from Newgate to Tyburn, the cart passed up Giltspur Street, and through Smithfield, to Cow Lane. Skinner Street had not then been built, and the Crooked Lane which turned down by St. Sepulchre's, as well as Ozier Lane, did not afford sufficient width to admit of the cavalcade passing by either of them, with convenience, to Holborn Hill, or &quot;the Heavy Hill,&quot; as it used to be called. The procession seems at no time to have had much of the solemn element about it. &quot;The heroes of the day were often,&quot; says a popular writer, &quot;on good terms with the mob, and jokes were exchanged between the men who were going to be hanged and the men who deserved to be.&quot;\n\n&quot;On St. Paul's Day,&quot; says Mr. Timbs (1868), &quot;service is performed in St. Sepulchre's, in accordance with the will of Mr. Paul Jervis, who, in 1717, devised certain land in trust that a sermon should be preached in the church upon every Paul's Day upon the excellence of the liturgy o the Church of England; the preacher to receive 40s. for such sermon. Various sums are also bequeathed to the curate, the clerk, the treasurer, and masters of the parochial schools. To the poor of the parish he bequeathed 20s. a-piece to ten of the poorest householders within that part of the parish of St. Sepulchre commonly called Smithfield quarter, \u00a34 to the treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and 6s. 8d. yearly to the clerk, who shall attend to receive the same. The residue of the yearly rents and profits is to be distributed unto and amongst such poor people of the parish of St. Sepulchre's, London, who shall attend the service and sermon. At the close of the service the vestry-clerk reads aloud an extract from the will, and then proceeds to the distribution of the money. In the evening the vicar, churchwardens, and common councilmen of the precinct dine together.&quot;\n\nIn 1749, a Mr. Drinkwater made a praiseworthy bequest. He left the parish of St. Sepulchre \u00a3500 to be lent in sums of \u00a325 to industrious young tradesmen. No interest was to be charged, and the money was to be lent for four years.\n\nNext to St. Sepulchre's, on Snow Hill, used to stand the famous old inn of the &quot;Saracen's Head.&quot; It was only swept away within the last few years by the ruthless army of City improvers: a view of it in course of demolition was given on page 439. It was one of the oldest of the London inns which bore the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; for a sign. One of Dick Tarlton's jests makes mention of the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; without Newgate, and Stow, describing this neighbourhood, speaks particularly of &quot;a fair large inn for receipt of travellers&quot; that &quot;hath to sign the 'Saracen's Head.'&quot; The courtyard had, to the last, many of the characteristics of an old English inn; there were galleries all round leading to the bedrooms, and a spacious gateway through which the dusty mail-coaches used to rumble, the tired passengers creeping forth &quot;thanking their stars in having escaped the highwaymen and the holes and sloughs of the road.&quot; Into that courtyard how many have come on their first arrival in London with hearts beating high with hope, some of whom have risen to be aldermen and sit in state as lord mayor, whilst others have gone the way of the idle apprentice and come to a sad end at Tyburn! It was at this inn that Nicholas Nickleby and his uncle waited upon the Yorkshire schoolmaster Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall. Mr. Dickens describes the tavern as it existed in the last days of mail-coaching, when it was a most important place for arrivals and departures in London:\u2014\n\n&quot;Next to the jail, and by consequence near to Smithfield also, and the Compter and the bustle and noise of the City, and just on that particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastwards seriously think of falling down on purpose, and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westwards not unfrequently fall by accident, is the coach-yard of the 'Saracen's Head' inn, its portals guarded by two Saracen's heads and shoulders, which it was once the pride and glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night, but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity, possibly because this species of humour is now confined to St. James's parish, where doorknockers are preferred as being more portable, and bell-wires esteemed as convenient tooth-picks. Whether this be the reason or not, there they are, frowning upon you from each side of the gateway; and the inn itself, garnished with another Saracen's head, frowns upon you from the top of the yard; while from the door of the hind-boot of all the red coaches that are standing therein, there glares a small Saracen's head with a twin expression to the large Saracen's head below, so that the general appearance of the pile is of the Saracenic order.&quot;\n\nTo explain the use of the Saracen's head as an inn sign various reasons have been given. &quot;When our countrymen,&quot; says Selden, &quot;came home from fighting with the Saracens and were beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible faces (as you still see the 'Saracen's Head' is), when in truth they were like other men. But this they did to save their own credit.&quot; Or the sign may have been adopted by those who had visited the Holy Land either as pilgrims or to fight the Saracens. Others, again, hold that it was first set up in compliment to the mother of Thomas \u00e0 Becket, who was the daughter of a Saracen. However this may be, it is certain that the use of the sign in former days was very general.\n\nRunning past the east end of St. Sepulchre's, from Newgate into West Smithfield, is Giltspur Street, anciently called Knightriders Street. This interesting thoroughfare derives its name from the knights with their gilt spurs having been accustomed to ride this way to the jousts and tournaments which in days of old were held in Smithfield.\n\nIn this street was Giltspur Street Compter, a debtors' prison and house of correction appertaining to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex. It stood over against St. Sepulchre's Church, and was removed hither from the east side of Wood Street, Cheapside, in 1791. At the time of its removal it was used as a place of imprisonment for debtors, but the yearly increasing demands upon the contracted space caused that department to be given up, and City debtors were sent to Whitecross Street. The architect was Dance, to whom we are also indebted for the grim pile of Newgate. The Compter was a dirty and appropriately convictlooking edifice. It was pulled down in 1855. Mr. Hepworth Dixon gave an interesting account of this City House of Correction, not long before its demolition, in his &quot;London Prisons&quot; (1850). &quot;Entering,&quot; he says, &quot;at the door facing St. Sepulchre's, the visitor suddenly finds himself in a low dark passage, leading into the offices of the gaol, and branching off into other passages, darker, closer, more replete with noxious smells, than even those of Newgate. This is the fitting prelude to what follows. The prison, it must be noticed, is divided into two principal divisions, the House of Correction and the Compter. The front in Giltspur Street, and the side nearest to Newgate Street, is called the Compter. In its wards are placed detenues of various kinds\u2014remands, committals from the police-courts, and generally persons waiting for trial, and consequently still unconvicted. The other department, the House of Correction, occupies the back portion of the premises, abutting on Christ's Hospital. Curious it is to consider how thin a wall divides these widely-separate worlds! And sorrowful it is to think what a difference of destiny awaits the children\u2014destiny inexorable, though often unearned in either case\u2014who, on the one side of it or the other, receive an eleemosynary education! The collegian and the criminal! Who shall say how much mere accident\u2014 circumstances over which the child has little power \u2014determines to a life of usefulness or mischief? From the yards of Giltspur Street prison almost the only objects visible, outside of the gaol itself, are the towers of Christ's Hospital; the only sounds audible, the shouts of the scholars at their play. The balls of the hospital boys often fall within the yards of the prison. Whether these sights and sounds ever cause the criminal to pause and reflect upon the courses of his life, we will not say, but the stranger visiting the place will be very apt to think for him. \u2026\n\n&quot;In the department of the prison called the House of Correction, minor offenders within the City of London are imprisoned. No transports are sent hither, nor is any person whose sentence is above three years in length.&quot; This able writer then goes on to tell of the many crying evils connected with the institution\u2014the want of air, the over-crowded state of the rooms, the absence of proper cellular accommodation, and the vicious intercourse carried on amongst the prisoners. The entire gaol, when he wrote, only contained thirty-six separate sleeping-rooms. Now by the highest prison calculation\u2014and this, be it noted, proceeds on the assumption that three persons can sleep in small, miserable, unventilated cells, which are built for only one, and are too confined for that, being only about one-half the size of the model cell for one at Pentonville\u2014it was only capable of accommodating 203 prisoners, yet by the returns issued at Michaelmas, 1850, it contained 246!\n\nA large section of the prison used to be devoted to female delinquents, but lately it was almost entirely given up to male offenders.\n\n&quot;The House of Correction, and the Compter portion of the establishment,&quot; says Mr. Dixon, &quot;are kept quite distinct, but it would be difficult to award the palm of empire in their respective facilities for demoralisation. We think the Compter rather the worse of the two. You are shown into a room, about the size of an apartment in an ordinary dwelling-house, which will be found crowded with from thirty to forty persons, young and old, and in their ordinary costume; the low thief in his filth and rags, and the member of the swell-mob with his bright buttons, flash finery, and false jewels. Here you notice the boy who has just been guilty of his first offence, and committed for trial, learning with a greedy mind a thousand criminal arts, and listening with the precocious instinct of guilty passions to stories and conversations the most depraved and disgusting. You regard him with a mixture of pity and loathing, for he knows that the eyes of his peers are upon him, and he stares at you with a familiar impudence, and exhibits a devil-may-care countenance, such as is only to be met with in the juvenile offender. Here, too, may be seen the young clerk, taken up on suspicion\u2014perhaps innocent\u2014who avoids you with a shy look of pain and uneasiness: what a hell must this prison be to him! How frightful it is to think of a person really untainted with crime, compelled to herd for ten or twenty days with these abandoned wretches!\n\n&quot;On the other, the House of Correction side of the gaol, similar rooms will be found, full of prisoners communicating with each other, laughing and shouting without hindrance. All this is so little in accordance with existing notions of prison discipline, that one is continually fancying these disgraceful scenes cannot be in the capital of England, and in the year of grace 1850. Very few of the prisoners attend school or receive any instruction; neither is any kind of employment afforded them, except oakum-picking, and the still more disgusting labour of the treadmill. When at work, an officer is in attendance to prevent disorderly conduct; but his presence is of no avail as a protection to the less depraved. Conversation still goes on; and every facility is afforded for making acquaintances, and for mutual contamination.&quot;\n\nAfter having long been branded by intelligent inspectors as a disgrace to the metropolis, Giltspur Street Compter was condemned, closed in 1854, and subsequently taken down.\n\nNearly opposite what used to be the site of the Compter, and adjoining Cock Lane, is the spot called Pie Corner, near which terminated the Great Fire of 1666. The fire commenced at Pudding Lane, it will be remembered, so it was singularly appropriate that it should terminate at Pie Corner. Under the date of 4th September, 1666, Pepys, in his &quot;Diary,&quot; records that &quot;W. Hewer this day went to see how his mother did, and comes home late, telling us how he hath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in Pye Corner being burned; so that the fire is got so far that way.&quot; The figure of a fat naked boy stands over a public house at the corner of the lane; it used to have the following warning inscription attached:\u2014 &quot;This boy is in memory put up of the late fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony, 1666.&quot; According to Stow, Pie Corner derived its name from the sign of a well-frequented hostelry, which anciently stood on the spot. Strype makes honourable mention of Pie Corner, as &quot;noted chiefly for cooks' shops and pigs dressed there during Bartholomew Fair.&quot; Our old writers have many references\u2014and not all, by the way, in the best taste\u2014to its cookstalls and dressed pork. Shadwell, for instance, in the Woman Captain (1680) speaks of &quot;meat dressed at Pie Corner by greasy scullions;&quot; and Ben Jonson writes in the Alchemist (1612)\u2014\n\n&quot;I shall put you in mind, sir, at Pie Corner,\nTaking your meal of steam in from cooks' stalls.&quot;\n\nAnd in &quot;The Great Boobee&quot; (&quot;Roxburgh Ballads&quot;):\n\n&quot;Next day I through Pie Corner passed;\nThe roast meat on the stall\nInvited me to take a taste;\nMy money was but small.&quot;\n\nBut Pie Corner seems to have been noted for more than eatables. A ballad from Tom D'Urfey's &quot;Pills to Purge Melancholy,&quot; describing Bartholomew Fair, eleven years before the Fire of London, says:\u2014\n\n&quot;At Pie-Corner end, mark well my good friend,\n'Tis a very fine dirty place;\nWhere there's more arrows and bows. \u2026\nThan was handled at Chivy Chase.&quot;\n\nWe have already given a view of Pie Corner in our chapter on Smithfield, page 361.\n\nHosier Lane, running from Cow Lane to Smithfield, and almost parallel to Cock Lane, is described by &quot;R. B.,&quot; in Strype, as a place not over-well built or inhabited. The houses were all old timber erections. Some of these\u2014those standing at the south corner of the lane\u2014were in the beginning of this century depicted by Mr. J. T. Smith, in his &quot;Ancient Topography of London.&quot; He describes them as probably of the reign of James I. The rooms were small, with low, unornamented ceilings; the timber, oak, profusely used; the gables were plain, and the walls lath and plaster. They were taken down in 1809.\n\nIn the corner house, in Mr. Smith's time, there was a barber whose name was Catchpole; at least, so it was written over the door. He was rather an odd fellow, and possessed, according to his own account, a famous relic of antiquity. He would gravely show his customers a short-bladed instrument, as the identical dagger with which Walworth killed Wat Tyler.\n\nHosier Lane, like Pie Corner, used to be a great resort during the time of Bartholomew Fair, &quot;all the houses,&quot; it is said in Strype, &quot;generally being made public for tippling.&quot;\n\nWe return now from our excursion to the north of St. Sepulchre's, and continue our rambles to the west, and before speaking of what is, let us refer to what has been.\n\nTurnagain Lane is not far from this. &quot;Near unto this Seacoal Lane,&quot; remarks Stow, &quot;in the turning towards Holborn Conduit, is Turnagain Lane, or rather, as in a record of the 5th of Edward III., Windagain Lane, for that it goeth down west to Fleet Dyke, from whence men must turn again the same way they came, but there it stopped.&quot; There used to be a proverb, &quot;He must take him a house in Turnagain Lane.&quot;\n\nA conduit formerly stood on Snow Hill, a little below the church. It is described as a building with four equal sides, ornamented with four columns and pediment, surmounted by a pyramid, on which stood a lamb\u2014a rebus on the name of Lamb, from whose conduit in Red Lion Street the water came. There had been a conduit there, however, before Lamb's day, which was towards the close of the sixteenth century.\n\nAt No. 37, King Street, Snow Hill, there used to be a ladies' charity school, which was established in 1702, and remained in the parish 145 years. Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale were subscribers to this school, and Johnson drew from it his story of Betty Broom, in &quot;The Idler.&quot; The world of domestic service, in Betty's days, seems to have been pretty much as now. Betty was a poor girl, bred in the country at a charity-school, maintained by the contributions of wealthy neighbours. The patronesses visited the school from time to time, to see how the pupils got on, and everything went well, till &quot;at last, the chief of the subscribers having passed a winter in London, came down full of an opinion new and strange to the whole country. She held it little less than criminal to teach poor girls to read and write. They who are born to poverty, she said, are born to ignorance, and will work the harder the less they know. She told her friends that London was in confusion by the insolence of servants; that scarcely a girl could be got for all-work, since education had made such numbers of fine ladies, that nobody would now accept a lower title than that of a waiting-maid, or something that might qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles, and to sit at work in the parlour window. But she was resolved, for her part, to spoil no more girls. Those who were to live by their hands should neither read nor write out of her pocket. The world was bad enough already, and she would have no part in making it worse.\n\n&quot;She was for a long time warmly opposed; but she persevered in her notions, and withdrew her subscription. Few listen, without a desire of conviction, to those who advise them to spare their money. Her example and her arguments gained ground daily; and in less than a year the whole parish was convinced that the nation would be ruined if the children of the poor were taught to read and write.&quot; So the school was dissolved, and Betty with the rest was turned adrift into the wide and cold world; and her adventures there any one may read in &quot;The Idler&quot; for himself.\n\nThere is an entry in the school minutes of 1763, to the effect that the ladies of the committee censured the schoolmistress for listening to the story of the Cock Lane ghost, and &quot;desired her to keep her belief in the article to herself.&quot;\n\nSkinner Street\u2014now one of the names of the past\u2014which ran by the south side of St. Sepulchre's, and formed the connecting link between Newgate Street and Holborn, received its name from Alderman Skinner, through whose exertions, about 1802, it was principally built. The following account of Skinner Street is from the picturesque pen of Mr. William Harvey (&quot;Aleph&quot;), whose long familiarity with the places he describes renders doubly valuable his many contributions to the history of London scenes and people:\u2014&quot;As a building speculation,&quot; he says, writing in 1863, &quot;it was a failure. When the buildings were ready for occupation, tall and substantial as they really were, the high rents frightened intending shopkeepers. Tenants were not to be had; and in order to get over the money difficulty, a lottery, sanctioned by Parliament, was commenced. Lotteries were then common tricks of finance, and nobody wondered at the new venture; but even the most desperate fortune-hunters were slow to invest their capital, and the tickets hung sadly on hand. The day for the drawing was postponed several times, and when it came, there was little or no excitement on the subject, and whoever rejoiced in becoming a house-owner on such easy terms, the original projectors and builders were understood to have suffered considerably. The winners found the property in a very unfinished condition. Few of the dwellings were habitable, and as funds were often wanting, a majority of the houses remained empty, and the shops unopened. After two or three years things began to improve; the vast many-storeyed house which then covered the site of Commercial Place was converted into a warehousing dep\u00f4t; a capital house opposite the 'Saracen's Head' was taken by a hosier of the name of Theobald, who, opening his shop with the determination of selling the best hosiery, and nothing else, was able to convince the citizens that his hose was first-rate, and, desiring only a living profit, succeeded, after thirty years of unwearied industry, in accumulating a large fortune. Theobald was possessed of literary tastes, and at the sale of Sir Walter Scott's manuscripts was a liberal purchaser. He also collected a library of exceedingly choice books, and when aristocratic customers purchased stockings of him, was soon able to interest them in matters of far higher interest\u2026\n\n&quot;The most remarkable shop\u2014but it was on the left-hand side, at a corner house\u2014was that established for the sale of children's books. It boasted an immense extent of window-front, extending from the entrance into Snow Hill, and towards Fleet Market. Many a time have I lingered with loving eyes over those fascinating story-books, so rich in gaily-coloured prints; such careful editions of the marvellous old histories, 'Puss in Boots,' 'Cock Robin,' 'Cinderella,' and the like. Fortunately the front was kept low, so as exactly to suit the capacity of a childish admirer. . . . . But Skinner Street did not prosper much, and never could compete with even the dullest portions of Holborn. I have spoken of some reputable shops; but you know the proverb, 'One swallow will not make a summer,' and it was a declining neighbourhood almost before it could be called new. In 1810 the commercial dep\u00f4t, which had been erected at a cost of \u00a325,000, and was the chief prize in the lottery, was destroyed by fire, never to be rebuilt\u2014a heavy blow and discouragement to Skinner Street, from which it never rallied. Perhaps the periodical hanging-days exercised an unfavourable influence, collecting, as they frequently did, all the thieves and vagabonds of London. I never sympathised with Pepys or Charles Fox in their passion for public executions, and made it a point to avoid those ghastly sights; but early of a Monday morning, when I had just reached the end of Giltspur Street, a miserable wretch had just been turned off from the platform of the debtors' door, and I was made the unwilling witness of his last struggles. That scene haunted me for months, and I often used to ask myself, 'Who that could help it would live in Skinner Street?' The next unpropitious event in these parts was the unexpected closing of the child's library. What could it mean? Such a well-to-do establishment shut up? Yes, the whole army of shutters looked blankly on the inquirer, and forbade even a single glance at 'Sinbad' or 'Robinson Crusoe.' It would soon be re-opened, we naturally thought; but the shutters never came down again. The whole house was deserted; not even a messenger in bankruptcy, or an ancient Charley, was found to regard the playful double knocks of the neighbouring juveniles. Gradually the glass of all the windows got broken in, a heavy cloud of black dust, solidifying into inches thick, gathered on sills and doors and brickwork, till the whole frontage grew as gloomy as Giant Despair's Castle. Not long after, the adjoining houses shared the same fate, and they remained from year to year without the slightest sign of life\u2014absolute scarecrows, darkening with their uncomfortable shadows the busy streets. Within half a mile, in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, there are (1863) seven houses in a similar predicament\u2014 window-glass demolished, doors cracked from top to bottom, spiders' webs hanging from every projecting sill or parapet. What can it mean? The loss in the article of rents alone must be over \u00a31,000 annually. If the real owners are at feud with imaginary owners, surely the property might be rendered valuable, and the proceeds invested. Even the lawyers can derive no profit from such hopeless abandonment. I am told the whole mischief arose out of a Chancery suit. Can it be the famous 'Jarndyce v. Jarndyce' case? And have all the heirs starved each other out? If so, what hinders our lady the Queen from taking possession? Any change would be an improvement, for these dead houses make the streets they cumber as dispiriting and comfortless as graveyards. Busy fancy will sometimes people them, and fill the dreary rooms with strange guests. Do the victims of guilt congregate in these dark dens? Do wretches 'unfriended by the world or the world's law,' seek refuge in these deserted nooks, mourning in the silence of despair over their former lives, and anticipating the future in unappeasable agony? Such things have been\u2014the silence and desolation of these doomed dwellings make them the more suitable for such tenants.&quot;\n\nA street is nothing without a mystery, so a mystery let these old tumble-down houses remain, whilst we go on to tell that, in front of No. 58, the sailor Cashman was hung in 1817, as we have already mentioned, for plundering a gunsmith's shop there. William Godwin, the author of &quot;Caleb Williams,&quot; kept a bookseller's shop for several years in Skinner Street, at No. 41, and published school-books in the name of Edward Baldwin. On the wall there was a stone carving of \u00c6sop reciting one of his fables to children.\n\nThe most noteworthy event of the life of Godwin was his marriage with the celebrated Mary Wollstonecraft, authoress of a &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women,&quot; whose congenial mind, in politics and morals, he ardently admired. Godwin's account of the way in which they got on together is worth reading:\u2014&quot;Ours,&quot; he writes, &quot;was not an idle happiness, a paradise of selfish and transitory pleasures. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to mention, that influenced by ideas I had long entertained, I engaged an apartment about twenty doors from our house, in the Polygon, Somers Town, which I designed for the purpose of my study and literary occupations. Trifles, however, will be interesting to some readers, when they relate to the last period of the life of such a person as Mary. I will add, therefore, that we were both of us of opinion, that it was possible for two persons to be too uniformly in each other's society. Influenced by that opinion, it was my practice to repair to the apartment I have mentioned as soon as I rose, and frequently not to make my appearance in the Polygon till the hour of dinner. We agreed in condemning the notion, prevalent in many situations in life, that a man and his wife cannot visit in mixed society but in company with each other, and we rather sought occasions of deviating from than of complying with this rule. By this means, though, for the most part, we spent the latter half of each day in one another's society, yet we were in no danger of satiety. We seemed to combine, in a considerable degree, the novelty and lively sensation of a visit with the more delicious and heartfelt pleasure of a domestic life.&quot;\n\nThis philosophic union, to Godwin's inexpressible affliction, did not last more than eighteen months, at the end of which time Mrs. Godwin died, leaving an only daughter, who in the course of time became the second wife of the poet Shelley, and was the author of the wild and extraordinary tale of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116<\/a>"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Jelltex","count_faves":"7","count_comments":"0","can_comment":0,"permissions":{"permcomment":1},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":67,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":160,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":213,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":333,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":427,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":533,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5610\/15167159463_8973e16abd_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":682,"pathalias":"jelltecks"},{"id":"15777634761","owner":"16105638@N00","secret":"8b0e5d45a3","server":"7475","farm":8,"title":"St Sepulchre Without Newgate, City of London","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"With the rain falling harder, it was a bit of a route march to Holborn and my next church, the stunning St Sepulchre, which was also open.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSt Sepulchre-without-Newgate, also known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Holborn), is an Anglican church in the City of London. It is located on Holborn Viaduct, almost opposite the Old Bailey. In medieval times it stood just outside (&quot;without&quot;) the now-demolished old city wall, near the Newgate. It has been a living of St John's College, Oxford, since 1622.\n\nThe original Saxon church on the site was dedicated to St Edmund the King and Martyr. During the Crusades in the 12th century the church was renamed St Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, in reference to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The name eventually became contracted to St Sepulchre.\n\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the City. It was completely rebuilt in the 15th century but was gutted by the Great Fire of London in 1666,[1] which left only the outer walls, the tower and the porch standing[2] -. Modified in the 18th century, the church underwent extensive restoration in 1878. It narrowly avoided destruction in the Second World War, although the 18th-century watch-house in its churchyard (erected to deter grave-robbers) was completely destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a coffered ceiling[3] installed in 1834. The Vicars' old residence has recently been renovated into a modern living quarter.\n\nDuring the reign of Mary I in 1555, St Sepulchre's vicar, John Rogers, was burned as a heretic.\n\nSt Sepulchre is named in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons as the &quot;bells of Old Bailey&quot;. Traditionally, the great bell would be rung to mark the execution of a prisoner at the nearby gallows at Newgate. The clerk of St Sepulchre's was also responsible for ringing a handbell outside the condemned man's cell in Newgate Prison to inform him of his impending execution. This handbell, known as the Execution Bell, now resides in a glass case to the south of the nave.\n\nThe church has been the official musicians' church for many years and is associated with many famous musicians. Its north aisle (formerly a chapel dedicated to Stephen Harding) is dedicated as the Musicians' Chapel, with four windows commemorating John Ireland, the singer Dame Nellie Melba, Walter Carroll and the conductor Sir Henry Wood respectively.[4] Wood, who &quot;at the age of fourteen, learned to play the organ&quot; at this church [1] and later became its organist, also has his ashes buried in this church.\n\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.[5] The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the City of London Rifles (the 6th Battalion London Regiment). The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate<\/a>\n\nThe Early History of St. Sepulchre's\u2014Its Destruction in 1666\u2014The Exterior and Interior\u2014The Early Popularity of the Church\u2014Interments here\u2014Roger Ascham, the Author of the &quot;Schoolmaster&quot;\u2014Captain John Smith, and his Romantic Adventures\u2014Saved by an Indian Girl\u2014 St. Sepulchre's Churchyard\u2014Accommodation for a Murderess\u2014The Martyr Rogers\u2014An Odd Circumstance\u2014Good Company for the Dead\u2014A Leap from the Tower\u2014A Warning Bell and a Last Admonition\u2014Nosegays for the Condemned\u2014The Route to the Gallows-tree\u2014 The Deeds of the Charitable\u2014The &quot;Saracen's Head&quot;\u2014Description by Dickens\u2014Giltspur Street\u2014Giltspur Street Compter\u2014A Disreputable Condition\u2014Pie Corner\u2014Hosier Lane\u2014A Spurious Relic\u2014The Conduit on Snow Hill\u2014A Ladies' Charity School\u2014Turnagain Lane\u2014Poor Betty!\u2014A Schoolmistress Censured\u2014Skinner Street\u2014Unpropitious Fortune\u2014William Godwin\u2014An Original Married Life.\n\nMany interesting associations\u2014Principally, however, connected with the annals of crime and the execution of the laws of England\u2014belong to the Church of St. Sepulchre, or St. 'Pulchre. This sacred edifice\u2014anciently known as St. Sepulchre's in the Bailey, or by Chamberlain Gate (now Newgate)\u2014stands at the eastern end of the slight acclivity of Snow Hill, and between Smithfield and the Old Bailey. The genuine materials for its early history are scanty enough. It was probably founded about the commencement of the twelfth century, but of the exact date and circumstances of its origin there is no record whatever. Its name is derived from the Holy Sepulchre of our Saviour at Jerusalem, to the memory of which it was first dedicated.\n\nThe earliest authentic notice of the church, according to Maitland, is of the year 1178, at which date it was given by Roger, Bishop of Sarum, to the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew. These held the right of advowson until the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., and from that time until 1610 it remained in the hands of the Crown. James I., however, then granted &quot;the rectory and its appurtenances, with the advowson of the vicarage,&quot; to Francis Phillips and others. The next stage in its history is that the rectory was purchased by the parishioners, to be held in fee-farm of the Crown, and the advowson was obtained by the President and Fellows of St. John the Baptist College, at Oxford.\n\nThe church was rebuilt about the middle of the fifteenth century, when one of the Popham family, who had been Chancellor of Normandy and Treasurer of the King's Household, with distinguished liberality erected a handsome chapel on the south side of the choir, and the very beautiful porch still remaining at the south-west corner of the building. &quot;His image,&quot; Stow says, &quot;fair graven in stone, was fixed over the said porch.&quot;\n\nThe dreadful fire of 1666 almost destroyed St. Sepulchre's, but the parishioners set energetically to work, and it was &quot;rebuilt and beautified both within and without.&quot; The general reparation was under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, and nothing but the walls of the old building, and these not entirely, were suffered to remain. The work was done rapidly, and the whole was completed within four years.\n\n&quot;The tower,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;retained its original aspect, and the body of the church, after its restoration, presented a series of windows between buttresses, with pointed heads filled with tracery, crowned by a string-course and battlements. In this form it remained till the year 1790, when it appears the whole fabric was found to be in a state of great decay, and it was resolved to repair it throughout. Accordingly the walls of the church were cased with Portland stone, and all the windows were taken out and replaced by others with plain semi-circular heads, as now seen\u2014certainly agreeing but badly with the tower and porch of the building, but according with the then prevailing spirit of economy. The battlements, too, were taken down, and a plain stone parapet was substituted, so that at this time (with the exception of the roof, which was wagon-headed, and presented on the outside an unsightly swell, visible above the parapet) the church assumed its present appearance.&quot; The ungainly roof was removed, and an entirely new one erected, about 1836.\n\nAt each corner of the tower\u2014&quot;one of the most ancient,&quot; says the author of &quot;Londinium Redivivum,&quot; &quot;in the outline of the circuit of London&quot; \u2014there are spires, and on the spires there are weathercocks. These have been made use of by Howell to point a moral: &quot;Unreasonable people,&quot; says he, &quot;are as hard to reconcile as the vanes of St. Sepulchre's tower, which never look all four upon one point of the heavens.&quot; Nothing can be said with certainty as to the date of the tower, but it is not without the bounds of probability that it formed part of the original building. The belfry is reached by a small winding staircase in the south-west angle, and a similar staircase in an opposite angle leads to the summit. The spires at the corners, and some of the tower windows, have very recently undergone several alterations, which have added much to the picturesqueness and beauty of the church.\n\nThe chief entrance to St. Sepulchre's is by a porch of singular beauty, projecting from the south side of the tower, at the western end of the church. The groining of the ceiling of this porch, it has been pointed out, takes an almost unique form; the ribs are carved in bold relief, and the bosses at the intersections represent angels' heads, shields, roses, &amp;c., in great variety.\n\nComing now to the interior of the church, we find it divided into three aisles, by two ranges of Tuscan columns. The aisles are of unequal widths, that in the centre being the widest, that to the south the narrowest. Semi-circular arches connect the columns on either side, springing directly from their capitals, without the interposition of an entablature, and support a large dental cornice, extending round the church. The ceiling of the middle aisle is divided into seven compartments, by horizontal bands, the middle compartment being formed into a small dome.\n\nThe aisles have groined ceilings, ornamented at the angles with doves, &amp;c., and beneath every division of the groining are small windows, to admit light to the galleries. Over each of the aisles there is a gallery, very clumsily introduced, which dates from the time when the church was built by Wren, and extends the whole length, excepting at the chancel. The front of the gallery, which is of oak, is described by Mr. Godwin as carved into scrolls, branches, &amp;c., in the centre panel, on either side, with the initials &quot;C. R.,&quot; enriched with carvings of laurel, which have, however, he says, &quot;but little merit.&quot;\n\nAt the east end of the church there are three semicircular-headed windows. Beneath the centre one is a large Corinthian altar-piece of oak, displaying columns, entablatures, &amp;c., elaborately carved and gilded.\n\nThe length of the church, exclusive of the ambulatory, is said to be 126 feet, the breadth 68 feet, and the height of the tower 140 feet.\n\nA singularly ugly sounding-board, extending over the preacher, used to stand at the back of the pulpit, at the east end of the church. It was in the shape of a large parabolic reflector, about twelve feet in diameter, and was composed of ribs of mahogany.\n\nAt the west end of the church there is a large organ, said to be the oldest and one of the finest in London. It was built in 1677, and has been greatly enlarged. Its reed-stops (hautboy, clarinet, &amp;c.) are supposed to be unrivalled. In Newcourt's time the church was taken notice of as &quot;remarkable for possessing an exceedingly fine organ, and the playing is thought so beautiful, that large congregations are attracted, though some of the parishioners object to the mode of performing divine service.&quot;\n\nOn the north side of the church, Mr. Godwin mentions, is a large apartment known as &quot;St. Stephen's Chapel.&quot; This building evidently formed a somewhat important part of the old church, and was probably appropriated to the votaries of the saint whose name it bears.\n\nBetween the exterior and the interior of the church there is little harmony. &quot;For example,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;the columns which form the south aisle face, in some instances, the centre of the large windows which occur in the external wall of the church, and in others the centre of the piers, indifferently.&quot; This discordance may likely enough have arisen from the fact that when the church was rebuilt, or rather restored, after the Great Fire, the works were done without much attention from Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nSt. Sepulchre's appears to have enjoyed considerable popularity from the earliest period of its history, if one is to judge from the various sums left by well-disposed persons for the support of certain fraternities founded in the church\u2014namely, those of St. Katherine, St. Michael, St. Anne, and Our Lady\u2014and by others, for the maintenance of chantry priests to celebrate masses at stated intervals for the good of their souls. One of the fraternities just named\u2014that of St. Katherine\u2014 originated, according to Stow, in the devotion of some poor persons in the parish, and was in honour of the conception of the Virgin Mary. They met in the church on the day of the Conception, and there had the mass of the day, and offered to the same, and provided a certain chaplain daily to celebrate divine service, and to set up wax lights before the image belonging to the fraternity, on all festival days.\n\nThe most famous of all who have been interred in St. Sepulchre's is Roger Ascham, the author of the &quot;Schoolmaster,&quot; and the instructor of Queen Elizabeth in Greek and Latin. This learned old worthy was born in 1515, near Northallerton, in Yorkshire. He was educated at Cambridge University, and in time rose to be the university orator, being notably zealous in promoting what was then a novelty in England\u2014the study of the Greek language. To divert himself after the fatigue of severe study, he used to devote himself to archery. This drew down upon him the censure of the all-work-and-no-play school; and in defence of himself, Ascham, in 1545, published &quot;Toxophilus,&quot; a treatise on his favourite sport. This book is even yet well worthy of perusal, for its enthusiasm, and for its curious descriptions of the personal appearance and manners of the principal persons whom the author had seen and conversed with. Henry VIII. rewarded him with a pension of \u00a310 per annum, a considerable sum in those days. In 1548, Ascham, on the death of William Grindall, who had been his pupil, was appointed instructor in the learned languages to Lady Elizabeth, afterwards the good Queen Bess. At the end of two years he had some dispute with, or took a disgust at, Lady Elizabeth's attendants, resigned his situation, and returned to his college. Soon after this he was employed as secretary to the English ambassador at the court of Charles V. of Germany, and remained abroad till the death of Edward VI. During his absence he had been appointed Latin secretary to King Edward. Strangely enough, though Queen Mary and her ministers were Papists, and Ascham a Protestant, he was retained in his office of Latin secretary, his pension was increased to \u00a320, and he was allowed to retain his fellowship and his situation as university orator. In 1554 he married a lady of good family, by whom he had a considerable fortune, and of whom, in writing to a friend, he gives, as might perhaps be expected, an excellent character. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, she not only required his services as Latin secretary, but as her instructor in Greek, and he resided at Court during the remainder of his life. He died in consequence of his endeavours to complete a Latin poem which he intended to present to the queen on the New Year's Day of 1569. He breathed his last two days before 1568 ran out, and was interred, according to his own directions, in the most private manner, in St. Sepulchre's Church, his funeral sermon being preached by Dr. Andrew Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's. He was universally lamented; and even the queen herself not only showed great concern, but was pleased to say that she would rather have lost ten thousand pounds than her tutor Ascham, which, from that somewhat closehanded sovereign, was truly an expression of high regard.\n\nAscham, like most men, had his little weaknesses. He had too great a propensity to dice and cock-fighting. Bishop Nicholson would try to convince us that this is an unfounded calumny, but, as it is mentioned by Camden, and other contemporary writers, it seems impossible to deny it. He died, from all accounts, in indifferent circumstances. &quot;Whether,&quot; says Dr. Johnson, referring to this, &quot;Ascham was poor by his own fault, or the fault of others, cannot now be decided; but it is certain that many have been rich with less merit. His philological learning would have gained him honour in any country; and among us it may justly call for that reverence which all nations owe to those who first rouse them from ignorance, and kindle among them the light of literature.&quot; His most valuable work, &quot;The Schoolmaster,&quot; was published by his widow. The nature of this celebrated performance may be gathered from the title: &quot;The Schoolmaster; or a plain and perfite way of teaching children to understand, write, and speak the Latin tongue. \u2026 And commodious also for all such as have forgot the Latin tongue, and would by themselves, without a schoolmaster, in short time, and with small pains, recover a sufficient habilitie to understand, write, and speak Latin: by Roger Ascham, ann. 1570. At London, printed by John Daye, dwelling over Aldersgate,&quot; a printer, by the way, already mentioned by us a few chapters back (see page 208), as having printed several noted works of the sixteenth century.\n\nDr. Johnson remarks that the instruction recommended in &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot; is perhaps the best ever given for the study of languages.\n\nHere also lies buried Captain John Smith, a conspicuous soldier of fortune, whose romantic adventures and daring exploits have rarely been surpassed. He died on the 21st of June, 1631. This valiant captain was born at Willoughby, in the county of Lincoln, and helped by his doings to enliven the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. He had a share in the wars of Hungary in 1602, and in three single combats overcame three Turks, and cut off their heads. For this, and other equally brave deeds, Sigismund, Duke of Transylvania, gave him his picture set in gold, with a pension of three hundred ducats; and allowed him to bear three Turks' heads proper as his shield of arms. He afterwards went to America, where he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Indians. He escaped from them, however, at last, and resumed his brilliant career by hazarding his life in naval engagements with pirates and Spanish men-of-war. The most important act of his life was the share he had in civilising the natives of New England, and reducing that province to obedience to Great Britain. In connection with his tomb in St. Sepulchre's, he is mentioned by Stow, in his &quot;Survey,&quot; as &quot;some time Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New England.&quot;\n\nCertainly the most interesting events of his chequered career were his capture by the Indians, and the saving of his life by the Indian girl Pocahontas, a story of adventure that charms as often as it is told. Bancroft, the historian of the United States, relates how, during the early settlement of Virginia, Smith left the infant colony on an exploring expedition, and not only ascended the river Chickahominy, but struck into the interior. His companions disobeyed his instructions, and being surprised by the Indians, were put to death. Smith preserved his own life by calmness and self-possession. Displaying a pocket-compass, he amused the savages by an explanation of its power, and increased their admiration of his superior genius by imparting to them some vague conceptions of the form of the earth, and the nature of the planetary system. To the Indians, who retained him as their prisoner, his captivity was a more strange event than anything of which the traditions of their tribes preserved the memory. He was allowed to send a letter to the fort at Jamestown, and the savage wonder was increased, for he seemed by some magic to endow the paper with the gift of intelligence. It was evident that their captive was a being of a high order, and then the question arose, Was his nature beneficent, or was he to be dreaded as a dangerous enemy? Their minds were bewildered, and the decision of his fate was referred to the chief Powhatan, and before Powhatan Smith was brought. &quot;The fears of the feeble aborigines,&quot; says Bancroft, &quot;were about to prevail, and his immediate death, already repeatedly threatened and repeatedly delayed, would have been inevitable, but for the timely intercession of Pocahontas, a girl twelve years old, the daughter of Powhatan, whose confiding fondness Smith had easily won, and who firmly clung to his neck, as his head was bowed down to receive the stroke of the tomahawks. His fearlessness, and her entreaties, persuaded the council to spare the agreeable stranger, who could make hatchets for her father, and rattles and strings of beads for herself, the favourite child. The barbarians, whose decision had long been held in suspense by the mysterious awe which Smith had inspired, now resolved to receive him as a friend, and to make him a partner of their councils. They tempted him to join their bands, and lend assistance in an attack upon the white men at Jamestown; and when his decision of character succeeded in changing the current of their thoughts, they dismissed him with mutual promises of friendship and benevolence. Thus the captivity of Smith did itself become a benefit to the colony; for he had not only observed with care the country between the James and the Potomac, and had gained some knowledge of the language and manners of the natives, but he now established a peaceful intercourse between the English and the tribes of Powhatan.&quot;\n\nOn the monument erected to Smith in St. Sepulchre's Church, the following quaint lines were formerly inscribed:\u2014\n\n&quot;Here lies one conquered that hath conquered kings,\nSubdued large territories, and done things\nWhich to the world impossible would seem,\nBut that the truth is held in more esteem.\nShall I report his former service done,\nIn honour of his God, and Christendom?\nHow that he did divide, from pagans three,\nTheir heads and lives, types of his chivalry?\u2014\nFor which great service, in that climate done,\nBrave Sigismundus, King of Hungarion,\nDid give him, as a coat of arms, to wear\nThese conquered heads, got by his sword and spear.\nOr shall I tell of his adventures since\nDone in Virginia, that large continent?\nHow that he subdued kings unto his yoke,\nAnd made those heathens flee, as wind doth smoke;\nAnd made their land, being so large a station,\nAn habitation for our Christian nation,\nWhere God is glorified, their wants supplied;\nWhich else for necessaries, must have died.\nBut what avails his conquests, now he lies\nInterred in earth, a prey to worms and flies?\nOh! may his soul in sweet Elysium sleep,\nUntil the Keeper, that all souls doth keep,\nReturn to judgment; and that after thence\nWith angels he may have his recompense.&quot;\n\nSir Robert Peake, the engraver, also found a last resting-place here. He is known as the master of William Faithorne\u2014the famous English engraver of the seventeenth century\u2014and governor of Basing House for the king during the Civil War under Charles I. He died in 1667. Here also was interred the body of Dr. Bell, grandfather of the originator of a well-known system of education.\n\n&quot;The churchyard of St. Sepulchre's,&quot; we learn from Maitland, &quot;at one time extended so far into the street on the south side of the church, as to render the passage-way dangerously narrow. In 1760 the churchyard was, in consequence, levelled, and thrown open to the public. But this led to much inconvenience, and it was re-enclosed in 1802.&quot;\n\nSarah Malcolm, the murderess, was buried in the churchyard of St. Sepulchre's in 1733. This coldhearted and keen-eyed monster in human form has had her story told by us already. The parishioners seem, on this occasion, to have had no such scruples as had been exhibited by their predecessors a hundred and fifty years previous at the burial of Awfield, a traitor. We shall see presently that in those more remote days they were desirous of having at least respectable company for their deceased relatives and friends in the churchyard.\n\n&quot;For a long period,&quot; says Mr. Godwin (1838), &quot;the church was surrounded by low mean buildings, by which its general appearance was hidden; but these having been cleared away, and the neighbourhood made considerably more open, St. Sepulchre's now forms a somewhat pleasing object, notwithstanding that the tower and a part of the porch are so entirely dissimilar in style to the remainder of the building.&quot; And since Godwin's writing the surroundings of the church have been so improved that perhaps few buildings in the metropolis stand more prominently before the public eye.\n\nIn the glorious roll of martyrs who have suffered at the stake for their religious principles, a vicar of St. Sepulchre's, the Reverend John Rogers, occupies a conspicuous place. He was the first who was burned in the reign of the Bloody Mary. This eminent person had at one time been chaplain to the English merchants at Antwerp, and while residing in that city had aided Tindal and Coverdale in their great work of translating the Bible. He married a German lady of good position, by whom he had a large family, and was enabled, by means of her relations, to reside in peace and safety in Germany. It appeared to be his duty, however, to return to England, and there publicly profess and advocate his religious convictions, even at the risk of death. He crossed the sea; he took his place in the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross; he preached a fearless and animated sermon, reminding his astonished audience of the pure and wholesome doctrine which had been promulgated from that pulpit in the days of the good King Edward, and solemnly warning them against the pestilent idolatry and superstition of these new times. It was his last sermon. He was apprehended, tried, condemned, and burned at Smithfield. We described, when speaking of Smithfield, the manner in which he met his fate.\n\nConnected with the martyrdom of Rogers an odd circumstance is quoted in the &quot;Churches of London.&quot; It is stated that when the bishops had resolved to put to death Joan Bocher, a friend came to Rogers and earnestly entreated his influence that the poor woman's life might be spared, and other means taken to prevent the spread of her heterodox doctrines. Rogers, however, contended that she should be executed; and his friend then begged him to choose some other kind of death, which should be more agreeable to the gentleness and mercy prescribed in the gospel. &quot;No,&quot; replied Rogers, &quot;burning alive is not a cruel death, but easy enough.&quot; His friend hearing these words, expressive of so little regard for the sufferings of a fellow-creature, answered him with great vehemence, at the same time striking Rogers' hand, &quot;Well, it may perhaps so happen that you yourself shall have your hands full of this mild burning.&quot; There is no record of Rogers among the papers belonging to St. Sepulchre's, but this may easily be accounted for by the fact that at the Great Fire of 1666 nearly all the registers and archives were destroyed.\n\nA noteworthy incident in the history of St. Sepulchre's was connected with the execution, in 1585, of Awfield, for &quot;sparcinge abrood certen lewed, sedicious, and traytorous bookes.&quot; &quot;When he was executed,&quot; says Fleetwood, the Recorder, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, July 7th of that year, &quot;his body was brought unto St. Pulcher's to be buryed, but the parishioners would not suffer a traytor's corpse to be laid in the earth where their parents, wives, children, kindred, masters, and old neighbours did rest; and so his carcass was returned to the burial-ground near Tyburn, and there I leave it.&quot;\n\nAnother event in the history of the church is a tale of suicide. On the 10th of April, 1600, a man named William Dorrington threw himself from the roof of the tower, leaving there a prayer for forgiveness.\n\nWe come now to speak of the connection of St. Sepulchre's with the neighbouring prison of Newgate. Being the nearest church to the prison, that connection naturally was intimate. Its clock served to give the time to the hangman when there was an execution in the Old Bailey, and many a poor wretch's last moments must it have regulated.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the altar a board with a list of charitable donations and gifts used to contain the following item:\u2014&quot;1605. Mr. Robert Dowe gave, for ringing the greatest bell in this church on the day the condemned prisoners are executed, and for other services, for ever, concerning such condemned prisoners, for which services the sexton is paid \u00a316s. 8d.\u2014\u00a350.\n\nIt was formerly the practice for the clerk or bellman of St. Sepulchre's to go under Newgate, on the night preceding the execution of a criminal, ring his bell, and repeat the following wholesome advice:\u2014\n\n&quot;All you that in the condemned hold do lie,\nPrepare you, for to-morrow you shall die;\nWatch all, and pray, the hour is drawing near\nThat you before the Almighty must appear;\nExamine well yourselves, in time repent,\nThat you may not to eternal flames be sent.\nAnd when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,\nThe Lord above have mercy on your souls.\nPast twelve o'clock!&quot;\n\nThis practice is explained by a passage in Munday's edition of Stow, in which it is told that a Mr. John Dowe, citizen and merchant taylor of London, gave \u00a350 to the parish church of St. Sepulchre's, under the following conditions:\u2014After the several sessions of London, on the night before the execution of such as were condemned to death, the clerk of the church was to go in the night-time, and also early in the morning, to the window of the prison in which they were lying. He was there to ring &quot;certain tolls with a hand-bell&quot; appointed for the purpose, and was afterwards, in a most Christian manner, to put them in mind of their present condition and approaching end, and to exhort them to be prepared, as they ought to be, to die. When they were in the cart, and brought before the walls of the church, the clerk was to stand there ready with the same bell, and, after certain tolls, rehearse a prayer, desiring all the people there present to pray for the unfortunate criminals. The beadle, also, of Merchant Taylors' Hall was allowed an &quot;honest stipend&quot; to see that this ceremony was regularly performed.\n\nThe affecting admonition\u2014&quot;affectingly good,&quot; Pennant calls it\u2014addressed to the prisoners in Newgate, on the night before execution, ran as follows:\u2014\n\n&quot;You prisoners that are within,\nWho, for wickedness and sin,\n\nafter many mercies shown you, are now appointed to die to-morrow in the forenoon; give ear and understand that, to-morrow morning, the greatest bell of St. Sepulchre's shall toll for you, in form and manner of a passing-bell, as used to be tolled for those that are at the point of death; to the end that all godly people, hearing that bell, and knowing it is for your going to your deaths, may be stirred up heartily to pray to God to bestow his grace and mercy upon you, whilst you live. I beseech you, for Jesus Christ's sake, to keep this night in watching and prayer, to the salvation of your own souls while there is yet time and place for mercy; as knowing to-morrow you must appear before the judgment-seat of your Creator, there to give an account of all things done in this life, and to suffer eternal torments for your sins committed against Him, unless, upon your hearty and unfeigned repentance, you find mercy through the merits, death, and passion of your only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return to Him.&quot;\n\nAnd the following was the admonition to condemned criminals, as they were passing by St. Sepulchre's Church wall to execution:\u2014&quot; All good people, pray heartily unto God for these poor sinners, who are now going to their death, for whom this great bell doth toll.\n\n&quot;You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask mercy of the Lord, for the salvation of your own souls, through the [merits, death, and passion of Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto Him.\n\n&quot;Lord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.\nLord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.&quot;\n\nThe charitable Mr. Dowe, who took such interest in the last moments of the occupants of the condemned cell, was buried in the church of St. Botolph, Aldgate.\n\nAnother curious custom observed at St. Sepulchre's was the presentation of a nosegay to every criminal on his way to execution at Tyburn. No doubt the practice had its origin in some kindly feeling for the poor unfortunates who were so soon to bid farewell to all the beauties of earth. One of the last who received a nosegay from the steps of St. Sepulchre's was &quot;Sixteen-string Jack,&quot; alias John Rann, who was hanged, in 1774, for robbing the Rev. Dr. Bell of his watch and eighteen pence in money, in Gunnersbury Lane, on the road to Brentford. Sixteen-string Jack wore the flowers in his button-hole as he rode dolefully to the gallows. This was witnessed by John Thomas Smith, who thus describes the scene in his admirable anecdotebook, &quot;Nollekens and his Times:&quot;\u2014&quot; I remember well, when I was in my eighth year, Mr. Nollekens calling at my father's house, in Great Portland Street, and taking us to Oxford Street, to see the notorious Jack Rann, commonly called Sixteenstring Jack, go to Tyburn to be hanged. \u2026 The criminal was dressed in a pea-green coat, with an immense nosegay in the button-hole, which had been presented to him at St. Sepulchre's steps; and his nankeen small-clothes, we were told, were tied at each knee with sixteen strings. After he had passed, and Mr. Nollekens was leading me home by the hand, I recollect his stooping down to me and observing, in a low tone of voice, 'Tom, now, my little man, if my father-in-law, Mr. Justice Welch, had been high constable, we could have walked by the side of the cart all the way to Tyburn.'&quot;\n\nWhen criminals were conveyed from Newgate to Tyburn, the cart passed up Giltspur Street, and through Smithfield, to Cow Lane. Skinner Street had not then been built, and the Crooked Lane which turned down by St. Sepulchre's, as well as Ozier Lane, did not afford sufficient width to admit of the cavalcade passing by either of them, with convenience, to Holborn Hill, or &quot;the Heavy Hill,&quot; as it used to be called. The procession seems at no time to have had much of the solemn element about it. &quot;The heroes of the day were often,&quot; says a popular writer, &quot;on good terms with the mob, and jokes were exchanged between the men who were going to be hanged and the men who deserved to be.&quot;\n\n&quot;On St. Paul's Day,&quot; says Mr. Timbs (1868), &quot;service is performed in St. Sepulchre's, in accordance with the will of Mr. Paul Jervis, who, in 1717, devised certain land in trust that a sermon should be preached in the church upon every Paul's Day upon the excellence of the liturgy o the Church of England; the preacher to receive 40s. for such sermon. Various sums are also bequeathed to the curate, the clerk, the treasurer, and masters of the parochial schools. To the poor of the parish he bequeathed 20s. a-piece to ten of the poorest householders within that part of the parish of St. Sepulchre commonly called Smithfield quarter, \u00a34 to the treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and 6s. 8d. yearly to the clerk, who shall attend to receive the same. The residue of the yearly rents and profits is to be distributed unto and amongst such poor people of the parish of St. Sepulchre's, London, who shall attend the service and sermon. At the close of the service the vestry-clerk reads aloud an extract from the will, and then proceeds to the distribution of the money. In the evening the vicar, churchwardens, and common councilmen of the precinct dine together.&quot;\n\nIn 1749, a Mr. Drinkwater made a praiseworthy bequest. He left the parish of St. Sepulchre \u00a3500 to be lent in sums of \u00a325 to industrious young tradesmen. No interest was to be charged, and the money was to be lent for four years.\n\nNext to St. Sepulchre's, on Snow Hill, used to stand the famous old inn of the &quot;Saracen's Head.&quot; It was only swept away within the last few years by the ruthless army of City improvers: a view of it in course of demolition was given on page 439. It was one of the oldest of the London inns which bore the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; for a sign. One of Dick Tarlton's jests makes mention of the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; without Newgate, and Stow, describing this neighbourhood, speaks particularly of &quot;a fair large inn for receipt of travellers&quot; that &quot;hath to sign the 'Saracen's Head.'&quot; The courtyard had, to the last, many of the characteristics of an old English inn; there were galleries all round leading to the bedrooms, and a spacious gateway through which the dusty mail-coaches used to rumble, the tired passengers creeping forth &quot;thanking their stars in having escaped the highwaymen and the holes and sloughs of the road.&quot; Into that courtyard how many have come on their first arrival in London with hearts beating high with hope, some of whom have risen to be aldermen and sit in state as lord mayor, whilst others have gone the way of the idle apprentice and come to a sad end at Tyburn! It was at this inn that Nicholas Nickleby and his uncle waited upon the Yorkshire schoolmaster Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall. Mr. Dickens describes the tavern as it existed in the last days of mail-coaching, when it was a most important place for arrivals and departures in London:\u2014\n\n&quot;Next to the jail, and by consequence near to Smithfield also, and the Compter and the bustle and noise of the City, and just on that particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastwards seriously think of falling down on purpose, and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westwards not unfrequently fall by accident, is the coach-yard of the 'Saracen's Head' inn, its portals guarded by two Saracen's heads and shoulders, which it was once the pride and glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night, but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity, possibly because this species of humour is now confined to St. James's parish, where doorknockers are preferred as being more portable, and bell-wires esteemed as convenient tooth-picks. Whether this be the reason or not, there they are, frowning upon you from each side of the gateway; and the inn itself, garnished with another Saracen's head, frowns upon you from the top of the yard; while from the door of the hind-boot of all the red coaches that are standing therein, there glares a small Saracen's head with a twin expression to the large Saracen's head below, so that the general appearance of the pile is of the Saracenic order.&quot;\n\nTo explain the use of the Saracen's head as an inn sign various reasons have been given. &quot;When our countrymen,&quot; says Selden, &quot;came home from fighting with the Saracens and were beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible faces (as you still see the 'Saracen's Head' is), when in truth they were like other men. But this they did to save their own credit.&quot; Or the sign may have been adopted by those who had visited the Holy Land either as pilgrims or to fight the Saracens. Others, again, hold that it was first set up in compliment to the mother of Thomas \u00e0 Becket, who was the daughter of a Saracen. However this may be, it is certain that the use of the sign in former days was very general.\n\nRunning past the east end of St. Sepulchre's, from Newgate into West Smithfield, is Giltspur Street, anciently called Knightriders Street. This interesting thoroughfare derives its name from the knights with their gilt spurs having been accustomed to ride this way to the jousts and tournaments which in days of old were held in Smithfield.\n\nIn this street was Giltspur Street Compter, a debtors' prison and house of correction appertaining to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex. It stood over against St. Sepulchre's Church, and was removed hither from the east side of Wood Street, Cheapside, in 1791. At the time of its removal it was used as a place of imprisonment for debtors, but the yearly increasing demands upon the contracted space caused that department to be given up, and City debtors were sent to Whitecross Street. The architect was Dance, to whom we are also indebted for the grim pile of Newgate. The Compter was a dirty and appropriately convictlooking edifice. It was pulled down in 1855. Mr. Hepworth Dixon gave an interesting account of this City House of Correction, not long before its demolition, in his &quot;London Prisons&quot; (1850). &quot;Entering,&quot; he says, &quot;at the door facing St. Sepulchre's, the visitor suddenly finds himself in a low dark passage, leading into the offices of the gaol, and branching off into other passages, darker, closer, more replete with noxious smells, than even those of Newgate. This is the fitting prelude to what follows. The prison, it must be noticed, is divided into two principal divisions, the House of Correction and the Compter. The front in Giltspur Street, and the side nearest to Newgate Street, is called the Compter. In its wards are placed detenues of various kinds\u2014remands, committals from the police-courts, and generally persons waiting for trial, and consequently still unconvicted. The other department, the House of Correction, occupies the back portion of the premises, abutting on Christ's Hospital. Curious it is to consider how thin a wall divides these widely-separate worlds! And sorrowful it is to think what a difference of destiny awaits the children\u2014destiny inexorable, though often unearned in either case\u2014who, on the one side of it or the other, receive an eleemosynary education! The collegian and the criminal! Who shall say how much mere accident\u2014 circumstances over which the child has little power \u2014determines to a life of usefulness or mischief? From the yards of Giltspur Street prison almost the only objects visible, outside of the gaol itself, are the towers of Christ's Hospital; the only sounds audible, the shouts of the scholars at their play. The balls of the hospital boys often fall within the yards of the prison. Whether these sights and sounds ever cause the criminal to pause and reflect upon the courses of his life, we will not say, but the stranger visiting the place will be very apt to think for him. \u2026\n\n&quot;In the department of the prison called the House of Correction, minor offenders within the City of London are imprisoned. No transports are sent hither, nor is any person whose sentence is above three years in length.&quot; This able writer then goes on to tell of the many crying evils connected with the institution\u2014the want of air, the over-crowded state of the rooms, the absence of proper cellular accommodation, and the vicious intercourse carried on amongst the prisoners. The entire gaol, when he wrote, only contained thirty-six separate sleeping-rooms. Now by the highest prison calculation\u2014and this, be it noted, proceeds on the assumption that three persons can sleep in small, miserable, unventilated cells, which are built for only one, and are too confined for that, being only about one-half the size of the model cell for one at Pentonville\u2014it was only capable of accommodating 203 prisoners, yet by the returns issued at Michaelmas, 1850, it contained 246!\n\nA large section of the prison used to be devoted to female delinquents, but lately it was almost entirely given up to male offenders.\n\n&quot;The House of Correction, and the Compter portion of the establishment,&quot; says Mr. Dixon, &quot;are kept quite distinct, but it would be difficult to award the palm of empire in their respective facilities for demoralisation. We think the Compter rather the worse of the two. You are shown into a room, about the size of an apartment in an ordinary dwelling-house, which will be found crowded with from thirty to forty persons, young and old, and in their ordinary costume; the low thief in his filth and rags, and the member of the swell-mob with his bright buttons, flash finery, and false jewels. Here you notice the boy who has just been guilty of his first offence, and committed for trial, learning with a greedy mind a thousand criminal arts, and listening with the precocious instinct of guilty passions to stories and conversations the most depraved and disgusting. You regard him with a mixture of pity and loathing, for he knows that the eyes of his peers are upon him, and he stares at you with a familiar impudence, and exhibits a devil-may-care countenance, such as is only to be met with in the juvenile offender. Here, too, may be seen the young clerk, taken up on suspicion\u2014perhaps innocent\u2014who avoids you with a shy look of pain and uneasiness: what a hell must this prison be to him! How frightful it is to think of a person really untainted with crime, compelled to herd for ten or twenty days with these abandoned wretches!\n\n&quot;On the other, the House of Correction side of the gaol, similar rooms will be found, full of prisoners communicating with each other, laughing and shouting without hindrance. All this is so little in accordance with existing notions of prison discipline, that one is continually fancying these disgraceful scenes cannot be in the capital of England, and in the year of grace 1850. Very few of the prisoners attend school or receive any instruction; neither is any kind of employment afforded them, except oakum-picking, and the still more disgusting labour of the treadmill. When at work, an officer is in attendance to prevent disorderly conduct; but his presence is of no avail as a protection to the less depraved. Conversation still goes on; and every facility is afforded for making acquaintances, and for mutual contamination.&quot;\n\nAfter having long been branded by intelligent inspectors as a disgrace to the metropolis, Giltspur Street Compter was condemned, closed in 1854, and subsequently taken down.\n\nNearly opposite what used to be the site of the Compter, and adjoining Cock Lane, is the spot called Pie Corner, near which terminated the Great Fire of 1666. The fire commenced at Pudding Lane, it will be remembered, so it was singularly appropriate that it should terminate at Pie Corner. Under the date of 4th September, 1666, Pepys, in his &quot;Diary,&quot; records that &quot;W. Hewer this day went to see how his mother did, and comes home late, telling us how he hath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in Pye Corner being burned; so that the fire is got so far that way.&quot; The figure of a fat naked boy stands over a public house at the corner of the lane; it used to have the following warning inscription attached:\u2014 &quot;This boy is in memory put up of the late fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony, 1666.&quot; According to Stow, Pie Corner derived its name from the sign of a well-frequented hostelry, which anciently stood on the spot. Strype makes honourable mention of Pie Corner, as &quot;noted chiefly for cooks' shops and pigs dressed there during Bartholomew Fair.&quot; Our old writers have many references\u2014and not all, by the way, in the best taste\u2014to its cookstalls and dressed pork. Shadwell, for instance, in the Woman Captain (1680) speaks of &quot;meat dressed at Pie Corner by greasy scullions;&quot; and Ben Jonson writes in the Alchemist (1612)\u2014\n\n&quot;I shall put you in mind, sir, at Pie Corner,\nTaking your meal of steam in from cooks' stalls.&quot;\n\nAnd in &quot;The Great Boobee&quot; (&quot;Roxburgh Ballads&quot;):\n\n&quot;Next day I through Pie Corner passed;\nThe roast meat on the stall\nInvited me to take a taste;\nMy money was but small.&quot;\n\nBut Pie Corner seems to have been noted for more than eatables. A ballad from Tom D'Urfey's &quot;Pills to Purge Melancholy,&quot; describing Bartholomew Fair, eleven years before the Fire of London, says:\u2014\n\n&quot;At Pie-Corner end, mark well my good friend,\n'Tis a very fine dirty place;\nWhere there's more arrows and bows. \u2026\nThan was handled at Chivy Chase.&quot;\n\nWe have already given a view of Pie Corner in our chapter on Smithfield, page 361.\n\nHosier Lane, running from Cow Lane to Smithfield, and almost parallel to Cock Lane, is described by &quot;R. B.,&quot; in Strype, as a place not over-well built or inhabited. The houses were all old timber erections. Some of these\u2014those standing at the south corner of the lane\u2014were in the beginning of this century depicted by Mr. J. T. Smith, in his &quot;Ancient Topography of London.&quot; He describes them as probably of the reign of James I. The rooms were small, with low, unornamented ceilings; the timber, oak, profusely used; the gables were plain, and the walls lath and plaster. They were taken down in 1809.\n\nIn the corner house, in Mr. Smith's time, there was a barber whose name was Catchpole; at least, so it was written over the door. He was rather an odd fellow, and possessed, according to his own account, a famous relic of antiquity. He would gravely show his customers a short-bladed instrument, as the identical dagger with which Walworth killed Wat Tyler.\n\nHosier Lane, like Pie Corner, used to be a great resort during the time of Bartholomew Fair, &quot;all the houses,&quot; it is said in Strype, &quot;generally being made public for tippling.&quot;\n\nWe return now from our excursion to the north of St. Sepulchre's, and continue our rambles to the west, and before speaking of what is, let us refer to what has been.\n\nTurnagain Lane is not far from this. &quot;Near unto this Seacoal Lane,&quot; remarks Stow, &quot;in the turning towards Holborn Conduit, is Turnagain Lane, or rather, as in a record of the 5th of Edward III., Windagain Lane, for that it goeth down west to Fleet Dyke, from whence men must turn again the same way they came, but there it stopped.&quot; There used to be a proverb, &quot;He must take him a house in Turnagain Lane.&quot;\n\nA conduit formerly stood on Snow Hill, a little below the church. It is described as a building with four equal sides, ornamented with four columns and pediment, surmounted by a pyramid, on which stood a lamb\u2014a rebus on the name of Lamb, from whose conduit in Red Lion Street the water came. There had been a conduit there, however, before Lamb's day, which was towards the close of the sixteenth century.\n\nAt No. 37, King Street, Snow Hill, there used to be a ladies' charity school, which was established in 1702, and remained in the parish 145 years. Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale were subscribers to this school, and Johnson drew from it his story of Betty Broom, in &quot;The Idler.&quot; The world of domestic service, in Betty's days, seems to have been pretty much as now. Betty was a poor girl, bred in the country at a charity-school, maintained by the contributions of wealthy neighbours. The patronesses visited the school from time to time, to see how the pupils got on, and everything went well, till &quot;at last, the chief of the subscribers having passed a winter in London, came down full of an opinion new and strange to the whole country. She held it little less than criminal to teach poor girls to read and write. They who are born to poverty, she said, are born to ignorance, and will work the harder the less they know. She told her friends that London was in confusion by the insolence of servants; that scarcely a girl could be got for all-work, since education had made such numbers of fine ladies, that nobody would now accept a lower title than that of a waiting-maid, or something that might qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles, and to sit at work in the parlour window. But she was resolved, for her part, to spoil no more girls. Those who were to live by their hands should neither read nor write out of her pocket. The world was bad enough already, and she would have no part in making it worse.\n\n&quot;She was for a long time warmly opposed; but she persevered in her notions, and withdrew her subscription. Few listen, without a desire of conviction, to those who advise them to spare their money. Her example and her arguments gained ground daily; and in less than a year the whole parish was convinced that the nation would be ruined if the children of the poor were taught to read and write.&quot; So the school was dissolved, and Betty with the rest was turned adrift into the wide and cold world; and her adventures there any one may read in &quot;The Idler&quot; for himself.\n\nThere is an entry in the school minutes of 1763, to the effect that the ladies of the committee censured the schoolmistress for listening to the story of the Cock Lane ghost, and &quot;desired her to keep her belief in the article to herself.&quot;\n\nSkinner Street\u2014now one of the names of the past\u2014which ran by the south side of St. Sepulchre's, and formed the connecting link between Newgate Street and Holborn, received its name from Alderman Skinner, through whose exertions, about 1802, it was principally built. The following account of Skinner Street is from the picturesque pen of Mr. William Harvey (&quot;Aleph&quot;), whose long familiarity with the places he describes renders doubly valuable his many contributions to the history of London scenes and people:\u2014&quot;As a building speculation,&quot; he says, writing in 1863, &quot;it was a failure. When the buildings were ready for occupation, tall and substantial as they really were, the high rents frightened intending shopkeepers. Tenants were not to be had; and in order to get over the money difficulty, a lottery, sanctioned by Parliament, was commenced. Lotteries were then common tricks of finance, and nobody wondered at the new venture; but even the most desperate fortune-hunters were slow to invest their capital, and the tickets hung sadly on hand. The day for the drawing was postponed several times, and when it came, there was little or no excitement on the subject, and whoever rejoiced in becoming a house-owner on such easy terms, the original projectors and builders were understood to have suffered considerably. The winners found the property in a very unfinished condition. Few of the dwellings were habitable, and as funds were often wanting, a majority of the houses remained empty, and the shops unopened. After two or three years things began to improve; the vast many-storeyed house which then covered the site of Commercial Place was converted into a warehousing dep\u00f4t; a capital house opposite the 'Saracen's Head' was taken by a hosier of the name of Theobald, who, opening his shop with the determination of selling the best hosiery, and nothing else, was able to convince the citizens that his hose was first-rate, and, desiring only a living profit, succeeded, after thirty years of unwearied industry, in accumulating a large fortune. Theobald was possessed of literary tastes, and at the sale of Sir Walter Scott's manuscripts was a liberal purchaser. He also collected a library of exceedingly choice books, and when aristocratic customers purchased stockings of him, was soon able to interest them in matters of far higher interest\u2026\n\n&quot;The most remarkable shop\u2014but it was on the left-hand side, at a corner house\u2014was that established for the sale of children's books. It boasted an immense extent of window-front, extending from the entrance into Snow Hill, and towards Fleet Market. Many a time have I lingered with loving eyes over those fascinating story-books, so rich in gaily-coloured prints; such careful editions of the marvellous old histories, 'Puss in Boots,' 'Cock Robin,' 'Cinderella,' and the like. Fortunately the front was kept low, so as exactly to suit the capacity of a childish admirer. . . . . But Skinner Street did not prosper much, and never could compete with even the dullest portions of Holborn. I have spoken of some reputable shops; but you know the proverb, 'One swallow will not make a summer,' and it was a declining neighbourhood almost before it could be called new. In 1810 the commercial dep\u00f4t, which had been erected at a cost of \u00a325,000, and was the chief prize in the lottery, was destroyed by fire, never to be rebuilt\u2014a heavy blow and discouragement to Skinner Street, from which it never rallied. Perhaps the periodical hanging-days exercised an unfavourable influence, collecting, as they frequently did, all the thieves and vagabonds of London. I never sympathised with Pepys or Charles Fox in their passion for public executions, and made it a point to avoid those ghastly sights; but early of a Monday morning, when I had just reached the end of Giltspur Street, a miserable wretch had just been turned off from the platform of the debtors' door, and I was made the unwilling witness of his last struggles. That scene haunted me for months, and I often used to ask myself, 'Who that could help it would live in Skinner Street?' The next unpropitious event in these parts was the unexpected closing of the child's library. What could it mean? Such a well-to-do establishment shut up? Yes, the whole army of shutters looked blankly on the inquirer, and forbade even a single glance at 'Sinbad' or 'Robinson Crusoe.' It would soon be re-opened, we naturally thought; but the shutters never came down again. The whole house was deserted; not even a messenger in bankruptcy, or an ancient Charley, was found to regard the playful double knocks of the neighbouring juveniles. Gradually the glass of all the windows got broken in, a heavy cloud of black dust, solidifying into inches thick, gathered on sills and doors and brickwork, till the whole frontage grew as gloomy as Giant Despair's Castle. Not long after, the adjoining houses shared the same fate, and they remained from year to year without the slightest sign of life\u2014absolute scarecrows, darkening with their uncomfortable shadows the busy streets. Within half a mile, in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, there are (1863) seven houses in a similar predicament\u2014 window-glass demolished, doors cracked from top to bottom, spiders' webs hanging from every projecting sill or parapet. What can it mean? The loss in the article of rents alone must be over \u00a31,000 annually. If the real owners are at feud with imaginary owners, surely the property might be rendered valuable, and the proceeds invested. Even the lawyers can derive no profit from such hopeless abandonment. I am told the whole mischief arose out of a Chancery suit. Can it be the famous 'Jarndyce v. Jarndyce' case? And have all the heirs starved each other out? If so, what hinders our lady the Queen from taking possession? Any change would be an improvement, for these dead houses make the streets they cumber as dispiriting and comfortless as graveyards. Busy fancy will sometimes people them, and fill the dreary rooms with strange guests. Do the victims of guilt congregate in these dark dens? Do wretches 'unfriended by the world or the world's law,' seek refuge in these deserted nooks, mourning in the silence of despair over their former lives, and anticipating the future in unappeasable agony? Such things have been\u2014the silence and desolation of these doomed dwellings make them the more suitable for such tenants.&quot;\n\nA street is nothing without a mystery, so a mystery let these old tumble-down houses remain, whilst we go on to tell that, in front of No. 58, the sailor Cashman was hung in 1817, as we have already mentioned, for plundering a gunsmith's shop there. William Godwin, the author of &quot;Caleb Williams,&quot; kept a bookseller's shop for several years in Skinner Street, at No. 41, and published school-books in the name of Edward Baldwin. On the wall there was a stone carving of \u00c6sop reciting one of his fables to children.\n\nThe most noteworthy event of the life of Godwin was his marriage with the celebrated Mary Wollstonecraft, authoress of a &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women,&quot; whose congenial mind, in politics and morals, he ardently admired. Godwin's account of the way in which they got on together is worth reading:\u2014&quot;Ours,&quot; he writes, &quot;was not an idle happiness, a paradise of selfish and transitory pleasures. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to mention, that influenced by ideas I had long entertained, I engaged an apartment about twenty doors from our house, in the Polygon, Somers Town, which I designed for the purpose of my study and literary occupations. Trifles, however, will be interesting to some readers, when they relate to the last period of the life of such a person as Mary. I will add, therefore, that we were both of us of opinion, that it was possible for two persons to be too uniformly in each other's society. Influenced by that opinion, it was my practice to repair to the apartment I have mentioned as soon as I rose, and frequently not to make my appearance in the Polygon till the hour of dinner. We agreed in condemning the notion, prevalent in many situations in life, that a man and his wife cannot visit in mixed society but in company with each other, and we rather sought occasions of deviating from than of complying with this rule. By this means, though, for the most part, we spent the latter half of each day in one another's society, yet we were in no danger of satiety. We seemed to combine, in a considerable degree, the novelty and lively sensation of a visit with the more delicious and heartfelt pleasure of a domestic life.&quot;\n\nThis philosophic union, to Godwin's inexpressible affliction, did not last more than eighteen months, at the end of which time Mrs. Godwin died, leaving an only daughter, who in the course of time became the second wife of the poet Shelley, and was the author of the wild and extraordinary tale of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116<\/a>"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Jelltex","count_faves":"4","count_comments":"0","can_comment":0,"permissions":{"permcomment":1},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_t.jpg","height_t":67,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_m.jpg","height_s":160,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_n.jpg","height_n":213,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3.jpg","height_m":333,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_z.jpg","height_z":427,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_c.jpg","height_c":533,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7475\/15777634761_8b0e5d45a3_b.jpg","height_l":683,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"jelltecks"},{"id":"15756507786","owner":"16105638@N00","secret":"06f2a31935","server":"8276","farm":9,"title":"St Sepulchre Without Newgate, City of London","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":0,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"With the rain falling harder, it was a bit of a route march to Holborn and my next church, the stunning St Sepulchre, which was also open.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSt Sepulchre-without-Newgate, also known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Holborn), is an Anglican church in the City of London. It is located on Holborn Viaduct, almost opposite the Old Bailey. In medieval times it stood just outside (&quot;without&quot;) the now-demolished old city wall, near the Newgate. It has been a living of St John's College, Oxford, since 1622.\n\nThe original Saxon church on the site was dedicated to St Edmund the King and Martyr. During the Crusades in the 12th century the church was renamed St Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, in reference to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The name eventually became contracted to St Sepulchre.\n\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the City. It was completely rebuilt in the 15th century but was gutted by the Great Fire of London in 1666,[1] which left only the outer walls, the tower and the porch standing[2] -. Modified in the 18th century, the church underwent extensive restoration in 1878. It narrowly avoided destruction in the Second World War, although the 18th-century watch-house in its churchyard (erected to deter grave-robbers) was completely destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a coffered ceiling[3] installed in 1834. The Vicars' old residence has recently been renovated into a modern living quarter.\n\nDuring the reign of Mary I in 1555, St Sepulchre's vicar, John Rogers, was burned as a heretic.\n\nSt Sepulchre is named in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons as the &quot;bells of Old Bailey&quot;. Traditionally, the great bell would be rung to mark the execution of a prisoner at the nearby gallows at Newgate. The clerk of St Sepulchre's was also responsible for ringing a handbell outside the condemned man's cell in Newgate Prison to inform him of his impending execution. This handbell, known as the Execution Bell, now resides in a glass case to the south of the nave.\n\nThe church has been the official musicians' church for many years and is associated with many famous musicians. Its north aisle (formerly a chapel dedicated to Stephen Harding) is dedicated as the Musicians' Chapel, with four windows commemorating John Ireland, the singer Dame Nellie Melba, Walter Carroll and the conductor Sir Henry Wood respectively.[4] Wood, who &quot;at the age of fourteen, learned to play the organ&quot; at this church [1] and later became its organist, also has his ashes buried in this church.\n\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.[5] The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the City of London Rifles (the 6th Battalion London Regiment). The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate<\/a>\n\nThe Early History of St. Sepulchre's\u2014Its Destruction in 1666\u2014The Exterior and Interior\u2014The Early Popularity of the Church\u2014Interments here\u2014Roger Ascham, the Author of the &quot;Schoolmaster&quot;\u2014Captain John Smith, and his Romantic Adventures\u2014Saved by an Indian Girl\u2014 St. Sepulchre's Churchyard\u2014Accommodation for a Murderess\u2014The Martyr Rogers\u2014An Odd Circumstance\u2014Good Company for the Dead\u2014A Leap from the Tower\u2014A Warning Bell and a Last Admonition\u2014Nosegays for the Condemned\u2014The Route to the Gallows-tree\u2014 The Deeds of the Charitable\u2014The &quot;Saracen's Head&quot;\u2014Description by Dickens\u2014Giltspur Street\u2014Giltspur Street Compter\u2014A Disreputable Condition\u2014Pie Corner\u2014Hosier Lane\u2014A Spurious Relic\u2014The Conduit on Snow Hill\u2014A Ladies' Charity School\u2014Turnagain Lane\u2014Poor Betty!\u2014A Schoolmistress Censured\u2014Skinner Street\u2014Unpropitious Fortune\u2014William Godwin\u2014An Original Married Life.\n\nMany interesting associations\u2014Principally, however, connected with the annals of crime and the execution of the laws of England\u2014belong to the Church of St. Sepulchre, or St. 'Pulchre. This sacred edifice\u2014anciently known as St. Sepulchre's in the Bailey, or by Chamberlain Gate (now Newgate)\u2014stands at the eastern end of the slight acclivity of Snow Hill, and between Smithfield and the Old Bailey. The genuine materials for its early history are scanty enough. It was probably founded about the commencement of the twelfth century, but of the exact date and circumstances of its origin there is no record whatever. Its name is derived from the Holy Sepulchre of our Saviour at Jerusalem, to the memory of which it was first dedicated.\n\nThe earliest authentic notice of the church, according to Maitland, is of the year 1178, at which date it was given by Roger, Bishop of Sarum, to the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew. These held the right of advowson until the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., and from that time until 1610 it remained in the hands of the Crown. James I., however, then granted &quot;the rectory and its appurtenances, with the advowson of the vicarage,&quot; to Francis Phillips and others. The next stage in its history is that the rectory was purchased by the parishioners, to be held in fee-farm of the Crown, and the advowson was obtained by the President and Fellows of St. John the Baptist College, at Oxford.\n\nThe church was rebuilt about the middle of the fifteenth century, when one of the Popham family, who had been Chancellor of Normandy and Treasurer of the King's Household, with distinguished liberality erected a handsome chapel on the south side of the choir, and the very beautiful porch still remaining at the south-west corner of the building. &quot;His image,&quot; Stow says, &quot;fair graven in stone, was fixed over the said porch.&quot;\n\nThe dreadful fire of 1666 almost destroyed St. Sepulchre's, but the parishioners set energetically to work, and it was &quot;rebuilt and beautified both within and without.&quot; The general reparation was under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, and nothing but the walls of the old building, and these not entirely, were suffered to remain. The work was done rapidly, and the whole was completed within four years.\n\n&quot;The tower,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;retained its original aspect, and the body of the church, after its restoration, presented a series of windows between buttresses, with pointed heads filled with tracery, crowned by a string-course and battlements. In this form it remained till the year 1790, when it appears the whole fabric was found to be in a state of great decay, and it was resolved to repair it throughout. Accordingly the walls of the church were cased with Portland stone, and all the windows were taken out and replaced by others with plain semi-circular heads, as now seen\u2014certainly agreeing but badly with the tower and porch of the building, but according with the then prevailing spirit of economy. The battlements, too, were taken down, and a plain stone parapet was substituted, so that at this time (with the exception of the roof, which was wagon-headed, and presented on the outside an unsightly swell, visible above the parapet) the church assumed its present appearance.&quot; The ungainly roof was removed, and an entirely new one erected, about 1836.\n\nAt each corner of the tower\u2014&quot;one of the most ancient,&quot; says the author of &quot;Londinium Redivivum,&quot; &quot;in the outline of the circuit of London&quot; \u2014there are spires, and on the spires there are weathercocks. These have been made use of by Howell to point a moral: &quot;Unreasonable people,&quot; says he, &quot;are as hard to reconcile as the vanes of St. Sepulchre's tower, which never look all four upon one point of the heavens.&quot; Nothing can be said with certainty as to the date of the tower, but it is not without the bounds of probability that it formed part of the original building. The belfry is reached by a small winding staircase in the south-west angle, and a similar staircase in an opposite angle leads to the summit. The spires at the corners, and some of the tower windows, have very recently undergone several alterations, which have added much to the picturesqueness and beauty of the church.\n\nThe chief entrance to St. Sepulchre's is by a porch of singular beauty, projecting from the south side of the tower, at the western end of the church. The groining of the ceiling of this porch, it has been pointed out, takes an almost unique form; the ribs are carved in bold relief, and the bosses at the intersections represent angels' heads, shields, roses, &amp;c., in great variety.\n\nComing now to the interior of the church, we find it divided into three aisles, by two ranges of Tuscan columns. The aisles are of unequal widths, that in the centre being the widest, that to the south the narrowest. Semi-circular arches connect the columns on either side, springing directly from their capitals, without the interposition of an entablature, and support a large dental cornice, extending round the church. The ceiling of the middle aisle is divided into seven compartments, by horizontal bands, the middle compartment being formed into a small dome.\n\nThe aisles have groined ceilings, ornamented at the angles with doves, &amp;c., and beneath every division of the groining are small windows, to admit light to the galleries. Over each of the aisles there is a gallery, very clumsily introduced, which dates from the time when the church was built by Wren, and extends the whole length, excepting at the chancel. The front of the gallery, which is of oak, is described by Mr. Godwin as carved into scrolls, branches, &amp;c., in the centre panel, on either side, with the initials &quot;C. R.,&quot; enriched with carvings of laurel, which have, however, he says, &quot;but little merit.&quot;\n\nAt the east end of the church there are three semicircular-headed windows. Beneath the centre one is a large Corinthian altar-piece of oak, displaying columns, entablatures, &amp;c., elaborately carved and gilded.\n\nThe length of the church, exclusive of the ambulatory, is said to be 126 feet, the breadth 68 feet, and the height of the tower 140 feet.\n\nA singularly ugly sounding-board, extending over the preacher, used to stand at the back of the pulpit, at the east end of the church. It was in the shape of a large parabolic reflector, about twelve feet in diameter, and was composed of ribs of mahogany.\n\nAt the west end of the church there is a large organ, said to be the oldest and one of the finest in London. It was built in 1677, and has been greatly enlarged. Its reed-stops (hautboy, clarinet, &amp;c.) are supposed to be unrivalled. In Newcourt's time the church was taken notice of as &quot;remarkable for possessing an exceedingly fine organ, and the playing is thought so beautiful, that large congregations are attracted, though some of the parishioners object to the mode of performing divine service.&quot;\n\nOn the north side of the church, Mr. Godwin mentions, is a large apartment known as &quot;St. Stephen's Chapel.&quot; This building evidently formed a somewhat important part of the old church, and was probably appropriated to the votaries of the saint whose name it bears.\n\nBetween the exterior and the interior of the church there is little harmony. &quot;For example,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;the columns which form the south aisle face, in some instances, the centre of the large windows which occur in the external wall of the church, and in others the centre of the piers, indifferently.&quot; This discordance may likely enough have arisen from the fact that when the church was rebuilt, or rather restored, after the Great Fire, the works were done without much attention from Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nSt. Sepulchre's appears to have enjoyed considerable popularity from the earliest period of its history, if one is to judge from the various sums left by well-disposed persons for the support of certain fraternities founded in the church\u2014namely, those of St. Katherine, St. Michael, St. Anne, and Our Lady\u2014and by others, for the maintenance of chantry priests to celebrate masses at stated intervals for the good of their souls. One of the fraternities just named\u2014that of St. Katherine\u2014 originated, according to Stow, in the devotion of some poor persons in the parish, and was in honour of the conception of the Virgin Mary. They met in the church on the day of the Conception, and there had the mass of the day, and offered to the same, and provided a certain chaplain daily to celebrate divine service, and to set up wax lights before the image belonging to the fraternity, on all festival days.\n\nThe most famous of all who have been interred in St. Sepulchre's is Roger Ascham, the author of the &quot;Schoolmaster,&quot; and the instructor of Queen Elizabeth in Greek and Latin. This learned old worthy was born in 1515, near Northallerton, in Yorkshire. He was educated at Cambridge University, and in time rose to be the university orator, being notably zealous in promoting what was then a novelty in England\u2014the study of the Greek language. To divert himself after the fatigue of severe study, he used to devote himself to archery. This drew down upon him the censure of the all-work-and-no-play school; and in defence of himself, Ascham, in 1545, published &quot;Toxophilus,&quot; a treatise on his favourite sport. This book is even yet well worthy of perusal, for its enthusiasm, and for its curious descriptions of the personal appearance and manners of the principal persons whom the author had seen and conversed with. Henry VIII. rewarded him with a pension of \u00a310 per annum, a considerable sum in those days. In 1548, Ascham, on the death of William Grindall, who had been his pupil, was appointed instructor in the learned languages to Lady Elizabeth, afterwards the good Queen Bess. At the end of two years he had some dispute with, or took a disgust at, Lady Elizabeth's attendants, resigned his situation, and returned to his college. Soon after this he was employed as secretary to the English ambassador at the court of Charles V. of Germany, and remained abroad till the death of Edward VI. During his absence he had been appointed Latin secretary to King Edward. Strangely enough, though Queen Mary and her ministers were Papists, and Ascham a Protestant, he was retained in his office of Latin secretary, his pension was increased to \u00a320, and he was allowed to retain his fellowship and his situation as university orator. In 1554 he married a lady of good family, by whom he had a considerable fortune, and of whom, in writing to a friend, he gives, as might perhaps be expected, an excellent character. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, she not only required his services as Latin secretary, but as her instructor in Greek, and he resided at Court during the remainder of his life. He died in consequence of his endeavours to complete a Latin poem which he intended to present to the queen on the New Year's Day of 1569. He breathed his last two days before 1568 ran out, and was interred, according to his own directions, in the most private manner, in St. Sepulchre's Church, his funeral sermon being preached by Dr. Andrew Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's. He was universally lamented; and even the queen herself not only showed great concern, but was pleased to say that she would rather have lost ten thousand pounds than her tutor Ascham, which, from that somewhat closehanded sovereign, was truly an expression of high regard.\n\nAscham, like most men, had his little weaknesses. He had too great a propensity to dice and cock-fighting. Bishop Nicholson would try to convince us that this is an unfounded calumny, but, as it is mentioned by Camden, and other contemporary writers, it seems impossible to deny it. He died, from all accounts, in indifferent circumstances. &quot;Whether,&quot; says Dr. Johnson, referring to this, &quot;Ascham was poor by his own fault, or the fault of others, cannot now be decided; but it is certain that many have been rich with less merit. His philological learning would have gained him honour in any country; and among us it may justly call for that reverence which all nations owe to those who first rouse them from ignorance, and kindle among them the light of literature.&quot; His most valuable work, &quot;The Schoolmaster,&quot; was published by his widow. The nature of this celebrated performance may be gathered from the title: &quot;The Schoolmaster; or a plain and perfite way of teaching children to understand, write, and speak the Latin tongue. \u2026 And commodious also for all such as have forgot the Latin tongue, and would by themselves, without a schoolmaster, in short time, and with small pains, recover a sufficient habilitie to understand, write, and speak Latin: by Roger Ascham, ann. 1570. At London, printed by John Daye, dwelling over Aldersgate,&quot; a printer, by the way, already mentioned by us a few chapters back (see page 208), as having printed several noted works of the sixteenth century.\n\nDr. Johnson remarks that the instruction recommended in &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot; is perhaps the best ever given for the study of languages.\n\nHere also lies buried Captain John Smith, a conspicuous soldier of fortune, whose romantic adventures and daring exploits have rarely been surpassed. He died on the 21st of June, 1631. This valiant captain was born at Willoughby, in the county of Lincoln, and helped by his doings to enliven the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. He had a share in the wars of Hungary in 1602, and in three single combats overcame three Turks, and cut off their heads. For this, and other equally brave deeds, Sigismund, Duke of Transylvania, gave him his picture set in gold, with a pension of three hundred ducats; and allowed him to bear three Turks' heads proper as his shield of arms. He afterwards went to America, where he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Indians. He escaped from them, however, at last, and resumed his brilliant career by hazarding his life in naval engagements with pirates and Spanish men-of-war. The most important act of his life was the share he had in civilising the natives of New England, and reducing that province to obedience to Great Britain. In connection with his tomb in St. Sepulchre's, he is mentioned by Stow, in his &quot;Survey,&quot; as &quot;some time Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New England.&quot;\n\nCertainly the most interesting events of his chequered career were his capture by the Indians, and the saving of his life by the Indian girl Pocahontas, a story of adventure that charms as often as it is told. Bancroft, the historian of the United States, relates how, during the early settlement of Virginia, Smith left the infant colony on an exploring expedition, and not only ascended the river Chickahominy, but struck into the interior. His companions disobeyed his instructions, and being surprised by the Indians, were put to death. Smith preserved his own life by calmness and self-possession. Displaying a pocket-compass, he amused the savages by an explanation of its power, and increased their admiration of his superior genius by imparting to them some vague conceptions of the form of the earth, and the nature of the planetary system. To the Indians, who retained him as their prisoner, his captivity was a more strange event than anything of which the traditions of their tribes preserved the memory. He was allowed to send a letter to the fort at Jamestown, and the savage wonder was increased, for he seemed by some magic to endow the paper with the gift of intelligence. It was evident that their captive was a being of a high order, and then the question arose, Was his nature beneficent, or was he to be dreaded as a dangerous enemy? Their minds were bewildered, and the decision of his fate was referred to the chief Powhatan, and before Powhatan Smith was brought. &quot;The fears of the feeble aborigines,&quot; says Bancroft, &quot;were about to prevail, and his immediate death, already repeatedly threatened and repeatedly delayed, would have been inevitable, but for the timely intercession of Pocahontas, a girl twelve years old, the daughter of Powhatan, whose confiding fondness Smith had easily won, and who firmly clung to his neck, as his head was bowed down to receive the stroke of the tomahawks. His fearlessness, and her entreaties, persuaded the council to spare the agreeable stranger, who could make hatchets for her father, and rattles and strings of beads for herself, the favourite child. The barbarians, whose decision had long been held in suspense by the mysterious awe which Smith had inspired, now resolved to receive him as a friend, and to make him a partner of their councils. They tempted him to join their bands, and lend assistance in an attack upon the white men at Jamestown; and when his decision of character succeeded in changing the current of their thoughts, they dismissed him with mutual promises of friendship and benevolence. Thus the captivity of Smith did itself become a benefit to the colony; for he had not only observed with care the country between the James and the Potomac, and had gained some knowledge of the language and manners of the natives, but he now established a peaceful intercourse between the English and the tribes of Powhatan.&quot;\n\nOn the monument erected to Smith in St. Sepulchre's Church, the following quaint lines were formerly inscribed:\u2014\n\n&quot;Here lies one conquered that hath conquered kings,\nSubdued large territories, and done things\nWhich to the world impossible would seem,\nBut that the truth is held in more esteem.\nShall I report his former service done,\nIn honour of his God, and Christendom?\nHow that he did divide, from pagans three,\nTheir heads and lives, types of his chivalry?\u2014\nFor which great service, in that climate done,\nBrave Sigismundus, King of Hungarion,\nDid give him, as a coat of arms, to wear\nThese conquered heads, got by his sword and spear.\nOr shall I tell of his adventures since\nDone in Virginia, that large continent?\nHow that he subdued kings unto his yoke,\nAnd made those heathens flee, as wind doth smoke;\nAnd made their land, being so large a station,\nAn habitation for our Christian nation,\nWhere God is glorified, their wants supplied;\nWhich else for necessaries, must have died.\nBut what avails his conquests, now he lies\nInterred in earth, a prey to worms and flies?\nOh! may his soul in sweet Elysium sleep,\nUntil the Keeper, that all souls doth keep,\nReturn to judgment; and that after thence\nWith angels he may have his recompense.&quot;\n\nSir Robert Peake, the engraver, also found a last resting-place here. He is known as the master of William Faithorne\u2014the famous English engraver of the seventeenth century\u2014and governor of Basing House for the king during the Civil War under Charles I. He died in 1667. Here also was interred the body of Dr. Bell, grandfather of the originator of a well-known system of education.\n\n&quot;The churchyard of St. Sepulchre's,&quot; we learn from Maitland, &quot;at one time extended so far into the street on the south side of the church, as to render the passage-way dangerously narrow. In 1760 the churchyard was, in consequence, levelled, and thrown open to the public. But this led to much inconvenience, and it was re-enclosed in 1802.&quot;\n\nSarah Malcolm, the murderess, was buried in the churchyard of St. Sepulchre's in 1733. This coldhearted and keen-eyed monster in human form has had her story told by us already. The parishioners seem, on this occasion, to have had no such scruples as had been exhibited by their predecessors a hundred and fifty years previous at the burial of Awfield, a traitor. We shall see presently that in those more remote days they were desirous of having at least respectable company for their deceased relatives and friends in the churchyard.\n\n&quot;For a long period,&quot; says Mr. Godwin (1838), &quot;the church was surrounded by low mean buildings, by which its general appearance was hidden; but these having been cleared away, and the neighbourhood made considerably more open, St. Sepulchre's now forms a somewhat pleasing object, notwithstanding that the tower and a part of the porch are so entirely dissimilar in style to the remainder of the building.&quot; And since Godwin's writing the surroundings of the church have been so improved that perhaps few buildings in the metropolis stand more prominently before the public eye.\n\nIn the glorious roll of martyrs who have suffered at the stake for their religious principles, a vicar of St. Sepulchre's, the Reverend John Rogers, occupies a conspicuous place. He was the first who was burned in the reign of the Bloody Mary. This eminent person had at one time been chaplain to the English merchants at Antwerp, and while residing in that city had aided Tindal and Coverdale in their great work of translating the Bible. He married a German lady of good position, by whom he had a large family, and was enabled, by means of her relations, to reside in peace and safety in Germany. It appeared to be his duty, however, to return to England, and there publicly profess and advocate his religious convictions, even at the risk of death. He crossed the sea; he took his place in the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross; he preached a fearless and animated sermon, reminding his astonished audience of the pure and wholesome doctrine which had been promulgated from that pulpit in the days of the good King Edward, and solemnly warning them against the pestilent idolatry and superstition of these new times. It was his last sermon. He was apprehended, tried, condemned, and burned at Smithfield. We described, when speaking of Smithfield, the manner in which he met his fate.\n\nConnected with the martyrdom of Rogers an odd circumstance is quoted in the &quot;Churches of London.&quot; It is stated that when the bishops had resolved to put to death Joan Bocher, a friend came to Rogers and earnestly entreated his influence that the poor woman's life might be spared, and other means taken to prevent the spread of her heterodox doctrines. Rogers, however, contended that she should be executed; and his friend then begged him to choose some other kind of death, which should be more agreeable to the gentleness and mercy prescribed in the gospel. &quot;No,&quot; replied Rogers, &quot;burning alive is not a cruel death, but easy enough.&quot; His friend hearing these words, expressive of so little regard for the sufferings of a fellow-creature, answered him with great vehemence, at the same time striking Rogers' hand, &quot;Well, it may perhaps so happen that you yourself shall have your hands full of this mild burning.&quot; There is no record of Rogers among the papers belonging to St. Sepulchre's, but this may easily be accounted for by the fact that at the Great Fire of 1666 nearly all the registers and archives were destroyed.\n\nA noteworthy incident in the history of St. Sepulchre's was connected with the execution, in 1585, of Awfield, for &quot;sparcinge abrood certen lewed, sedicious, and traytorous bookes.&quot; &quot;When he was executed,&quot; says Fleetwood, the Recorder, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, July 7th of that year, &quot;his body was brought unto St. Pulcher's to be buryed, but the parishioners would not suffer a traytor's corpse to be laid in the earth where their parents, wives, children, kindred, masters, and old neighbours did rest; and so his carcass was returned to the burial-ground near Tyburn, and there I leave it.&quot;\n\nAnother event in the history of the church is a tale of suicide. On the 10th of April, 1600, a man named William Dorrington threw himself from the roof of the tower, leaving there a prayer for forgiveness.\n\nWe come now to speak of the connection of St. Sepulchre's with the neighbouring prison of Newgate. Being the nearest church to the prison, that connection naturally was intimate. Its clock served to give the time to the hangman when there was an execution in the Old Bailey, and many a poor wretch's last moments must it have regulated.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the altar a board with a list of charitable donations and gifts used to contain the following item:\u2014&quot;1605. Mr. Robert Dowe gave, for ringing the greatest bell in this church on the day the condemned prisoners are executed, and for other services, for ever, concerning such condemned prisoners, for which services the sexton is paid \u00a316s. 8d.\u2014\u00a350.\n\nIt was formerly the practice for the clerk or bellman of St. Sepulchre's to go under Newgate, on the night preceding the execution of a criminal, ring his bell, and repeat the following wholesome advice:\u2014\n\n&quot;All you that in the condemned hold do lie,\nPrepare you, for to-morrow you shall die;\nWatch all, and pray, the hour is drawing near\nThat you before the Almighty must appear;\nExamine well yourselves, in time repent,\nThat you may not to eternal flames be sent.\nAnd when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,\nThe Lord above have mercy on your souls.\nPast twelve o'clock!&quot;\n\nThis practice is explained by a passage in Munday's edition of Stow, in which it is told that a Mr. John Dowe, citizen and merchant taylor of London, gave \u00a350 to the parish church of St. Sepulchre's, under the following conditions:\u2014After the several sessions of London, on the night before the execution of such as were condemned to death, the clerk of the church was to go in the night-time, and also early in the morning, to the window of the prison in which they were lying. He was there to ring &quot;certain tolls with a hand-bell&quot; appointed for the purpose, and was afterwards, in a most Christian manner, to put them in mind of their present condition and approaching end, and to exhort them to be prepared, as they ought to be, to die. When they were in the cart, and brought before the walls of the church, the clerk was to stand there ready with the same bell, and, after certain tolls, rehearse a prayer, desiring all the people there present to pray for the unfortunate criminals. The beadle, also, of Merchant Taylors' Hall was allowed an &quot;honest stipend&quot; to see that this ceremony was regularly performed.\n\nThe affecting admonition\u2014&quot;affectingly good,&quot; Pennant calls it\u2014addressed to the prisoners in Newgate, on the night before execution, ran as follows:\u2014\n\n&quot;You prisoners that are within,\nWho, for wickedness and sin,\n\nafter many mercies shown you, are now appointed to die to-morrow in the forenoon; give ear and understand that, to-morrow morning, the greatest bell of St. Sepulchre's shall toll for you, in form and manner of a passing-bell, as used to be tolled for those that are at the point of death; to the end that all godly people, hearing that bell, and knowing it is for your going to your deaths, may be stirred up heartily to pray to God to bestow his grace and mercy upon you, whilst you live. I beseech you, for Jesus Christ's sake, to keep this night in watching and prayer, to the salvation of your own souls while there is yet time and place for mercy; as knowing to-morrow you must appear before the judgment-seat of your Creator, there to give an account of all things done in this life, and to suffer eternal torments for your sins committed against Him, unless, upon your hearty and unfeigned repentance, you find mercy through the merits, death, and passion of your only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return to Him.&quot;\n\nAnd the following was the admonition to condemned criminals, as they were passing by St. Sepulchre's Church wall to execution:\u2014&quot; All good people, pray heartily unto God for these poor sinners, who are now going to their death, for whom this great bell doth toll.\n\n&quot;You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask mercy of the Lord, for the salvation of your own souls, through the [merits, death, and passion of Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto Him.\n\n&quot;Lord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.\nLord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.&quot;\n\nThe charitable Mr. Dowe, who took such interest in the last moments of the occupants of the condemned cell, was buried in the church of St. Botolph, Aldgate.\n\nAnother curious custom observed at St. Sepulchre's was the presentation of a nosegay to every criminal on his way to execution at Tyburn. No doubt the practice had its origin in some kindly feeling for the poor unfortunates who were so soon to bid farewell to all the beauties of earth. One of the last who received a nosegay from the steps of St. Sepulchre's was &quot;Sixteen-string Jack,&quot; alias John Rann, who was hanged, in 1774, for robbing the Rev. Dr. Bell of his watch and eighteen pence in money, in Gunnersbury Lane, on the road to Brentford. Sixteen-string Jack wore the flowers in his button-hole as he rode dolefully to the gallows. This was witnessed by John Thomas Smith, who thus describes the scene in his admirable anecdotebook, &quot;Nollekens and his Times:&quot;\u2014&quot; I remember well, when I was in my eighth year, Mr. Nollekens calling at my father's house, in Great Portland Street, and taking us to Oxford Street, to see the notorious Jack Rann, commonly called Sixteenstring Jack, go to Tyburn to be hanged. \u2026 The criminal was dressed in a pea-green coat, with an immense nosegay in the button-hole, which had been presented to him at St. Sepulchre's steps; and his nankeen small-clothes, we were told, were tied at each knee with sixteen strings. After he had passed, and Mr. Nollekens was leading me home by the hand, I recollect his stooping down to me and observing, in a low tone of voice, 'Tom, now, my little man, if my father-in-law, Mr. Justice Welch, had been high constable, we could have walked by the side of the cart all the way to Tyburn.'&quot;\n\nWhen criminals were conveyed from Newgate to Tyburn, the cart passed up Giltspur Street, and through Smithfield, to Cow Lane. Skinner Street had not then been built, and the Crooked Lane which turned down by St. Sepulchre's, as well as Ozier Lane, did not afford sufficient width to admit of the cavalcade passing by either of them, with convenience, to Holborn Hill, or &quot;the Heavy Hill,&quot; as it used to be called. The procession seems at no time to have had much of the solemn element about it. &quot;The heroes of the day were often,&quot; says a popular writer, &quot;on good terms with the mob, and jokes were exchanged between the men who were going to be hanged and the men who deserved to be.&quot;\n\n&quot;On St. Paul's Day,&quot; says Mr. Timbs (1868), &quot;service is performed in St. Sepulchre's, in accordance with the will of Mr. Paul Jervis, who, in 1717, devised certain land in trust that a sermon should be preached in the church upon every Paul's Day upon the excellence of the liturgy o the Church of England; the preacher to receive 40s. for such sermon. Various sums are also bequeathed to the curate, the clerk, the treasurer, and masters of the parochial schools. To the poor of the parish he bequeathed 20s. a-piece to ten of the poorest householders within that part of the parish of St. Sepulchre commonly called Smithfield quarter, \u00a34 to the treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and 6s. 8d. yearly to the clerk, who shall attend to receive the same. The residue of the yearly rents and profits is to be distributed unto and amongst such poor people of the parish of St. Sepulchre's, London, who shall attend the service and sermon. At the close of the service the vestry-clerk reads aloud an extract from the will, and then proceeds to the distribution of the money. In the evening the vicar, churchwardens, and common councilmen of the precinct dine together.&quot;\n\nIn 1749, a Mr. Drinkwater made a praiseworthy bequest. He left the parish of St. Sepulchre \u00a3500 to be lent in sums of \u00a325 to industrious young tradesmen. No interest was to be charged, and the money was to be lent for four years.\n\nNext to St. Sepulchre's, on Snow Hill, used to stand the famous old inn of the &quot;Saracen's Head.&quot; It was only swept away within the last few years by the ruthless army of City improvers: a view of it in course of demolition was given on page 439. It was one of the oldest of the London inns which bore the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; for a sign. One of Dick Tarlton's jests makes mention of the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; without Newgate, and Stow, describing this neighbourhood, speaks particularly of &quot;a fair large inn for receipt of travellers&quot; that &quot;hath to sign the 'Saracen's Head.'&quot; The courtyard had, to the last, many of the characteristics of an old English inn; there were galleries all round leading to the bedrooms, and a spacious gateway through which the dusty mail-coaches used to rumble, the tired passengers creeping forth &quot;thanking their stars in having escaped the highwaymen and the holes and sloughs of the road.&quot; Into that courtyard how many have come on their first arrival in London with hearts beating high with hope, some of whom have risen to be aldermen and sit in state as lord mayor, whilst others have gone the way of the idle apprentice and come to a sad end at Tyburn! It was at this inn that Nicholas Nickleby and his uncle waited upon the Yorkshire schoolmaster Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall. Mr. Dickens describes the tavern as it existed in the last days of mail-coaching, when it was a most important place for arrivals and departures in London:\u2014\n\n&quot;Next to the jail, and by consequence near to Smithfield also, and the Compter and the bustle and noise of the City, and just on that particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastwards seriously think of falling down on purpose, and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westwards not unfrequently fall by accident, is the coach-yard of the 'Saracen's Head' inn, its portals guarded by two Saracen's heads and shoulders, which it was once the pride and glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night, but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity, possibly because this species of humour is now confined to St. James's parish, where doorknockers are preferred as being more portable, and bell-wires esteemed as convenient tooth-picks. Whether this be the reason or not, there they are, frowning upon you from each side of the gateway; and the inn itself, garnished with another Saracen's head, frowns upon you from the top of the yard; while from the door of the hind-boot of all the red coaches that are standing therein, there glares a small Saracen's head with a twin expression to the large Saracen's head below, so that the general appearance of the pile is of the Saracenic order.&quot;\n\nTo explain the use of the Saracen's head as an inn sign various reasons have been given. &quot;When our countrymen,&quot; says Selden, &quot;came home from fighting with the Saracens and were beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible faces (as you still see the 'Saracen's Head' is), when in truth they were like other men. But this they did to save their own credit.&quot; Or the sign may have been adopted by those who had visited the Holy Land either as pilgrims or to fight the Saracens. Others, again, hold that it was first set up in compliment to the mother of Thomas \u00e0 Becket, who was the daughter of a Saracen. However this may be, it is certain that the use of the sign in former days was very general.\n\nRunning past the east end of St. Sepulchre's, from Newgate into West Smithfield, is Giltspur Street, anciently called Knightriders Street. This interesting thoroughfare derives its name from the knights with their gilt spurs having been accustomed to ride this way to the jousts and tournaments which in days of old were held in Smithfield.\n\nIn this street was Giltspur Street Compter, a debtors' prison and house of correction appertaining to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex. It stood over against St. Sepulchre's Church, and was removed hither from the east side of Wood Street, Cheapside, in 1791. At the time of its removal it was used as a place of imprisonment for debtors, but the yearly increasing demands upon the contracted space caused that department to be given up, and City debtors were sent to Whitecross Street. The architect was Dance, to whom we are also indebted for the grim pile of Newgate. The Compter was a dirty and appropriately convictlooking edifice. It was pulled down in 1855. Mr. Hepworth Dixon gave an interesting account of this City House of Correction, not long before its demolition, in his &quot;London Prisons&quot; (1850). &quot;Entering,&quot; he says, &quot;at the door facing St. Sepulchre's, the visitor suddenly finds himself in a low dark passage, leading into the offices of the gaol, and branching off into other passages, darker, closer, more replete with noxious smells, than even those of Newgate. This is the fitting prelude to what follows. The prison, it must be noticed, is divided into two principal divisions, the House of Correction and the Compter. The front in Giltspur Street, and the side nearest to Newgate Street, is called the Compter. In its wards are placed detenues of various kinds\u2014remands, committals from the police-courts, and generally persons waiting for trial, and consequently still unconvicted. The other department, the House of Correction, occupies the back portion of the premises, abutting on Christ's Hospital. Curious it is to consider how thin a wall divides these widely-separate worlds! And sorrowful it is to think what a difference of destiny awaits the children\u2014destiny inexorable, though often unearned in either case\u2014who, on the one side of it or the other, receive an eleemosynary education! The collegian and the criminal! Who shall say how much mere accident\u2014 circumstances over which the child has little power \u2014determines to a life of usefulness or mischief? From the yards of Giltspur Street prison almost the only objects visible, outside of the gaol itself, are the towers of Christ's Hospital; the only sounds audible, the shouts of the scholars at their play. The balls of the hospital boys often fall within the yards of the prison. Whether these sights and sounds ever cause the criminal to pause and reflect upon the courses of his life, we will not say, but the stranger visiting the place will be very apt to think for him. \u2026\n\n&quot;In the department of the prison called the House of Correction, minor offenders within the City of London are imprisoned. No transports are sent hither, nor is any person whose sentence is above three years in length.&quot; This able writer then goes on to tell of the many crying evils connected with the institution\u2014the want of air, the over-crowded state of the rooms, the absence of proper cellular accommodation, and the vicious intercourse carried on amongst the prisoners. The entire gaol, when he wrote, only contained thirty-six separate sleeping-rooms. Now by the highest prison calculation\u2014and this, be it noted, proceeds on the assumption that three persons can sleep in small, miserable, unventilated cells, which are built for only one, and are too confined for that, being only about one-half the size of the model cell for one at Pentonville\u2014it was only capable of accommodating 203 prisoners, yet by the returns issued at Michaelmas, 1850, it contained 246!\n\nA large section of the prison used to be devoted to female delinquents, but lately it was almost entirely given up to male offenders.\n\n&quot;The House of Correction, and the Compter portion of the establishment,&quot; says Mr. Dixon, &quot;are kept quite distinct, but it would be difficult to award the palm of empire in their respective facilities for demoralisation. We think the Compter rather the worse of the two. You are shown into a room, about the size of an apartment in an ordinary dwelling-house, which will be found crowded with from thirty to forty persons, young and old, and in their ordinary costume; the low thief in his filth and rags, and the member of the swell-mob with his bright buttons, flash finery, and false jewels. Here you notice the boy who has just been guilty of his first offence, and committed for trial, learning with a greedy mind a thousand criminal arts, and listening with the precocious instinct of guilty passions to stories and conversations the most depraved and disgusting. You regard him with a mixture of pity and loathing, for he knows that the eyes of his peers are upon him, and he stares at you with a familiar impudence, and exhibits a devil-may-care countenance, such as is only to be met with in the juvenile offender. Here, too, may be seen the young clerk, taken up on suspicion\u2014perhaps innocent\u2014who avoids you with a shy look of pain and uneasiness: what a hell must this prison be to him! How frightful it is to think of a person really untainted with crime, compelled to herd for ten or twenty days with these abandoned wretches!\n\n&quot;On the other, the House of Correction side of the gaol, similar rooms will be found, full of prisoners communicating with each other, laughing and shouting without hindrance. All this is so little in accordance with existing notions of prison discipline, that one is continually fancying these disgraceful scenes cannot be in the capital of England, and in the year of grace 1850. Very few of the prisoners attend school or receive any instruction; neither is any kind of employment afforded them, except oakum-picking, and the still more disgusting labour of the treadmill. When at work, an officer is in attendance to prevent disorderly conduct; but his presence is of no avail as a protection to the less depraved. Conversation still goes on; and every facility is afforded for making acquaintances, and for mutual contamination.&quot;\n\nAfter having long been branded by intelligent inspectors as a disgrace to the metropolis, Giltspur Street Compter was condemned, closed in 1854, and subsequently taken down.\n\nNearly opposite what used to be the site of the Compter, and adjoining Cock Lane, is the spot called Pie Corner, near which terminated the Great Fire of 1666. The fire commenced at Pudding Lane, it will be remembered, so it was singularly appropriate that it should terminate at Pie Corner. Under the date of 4th September, 1666, Pepys, in his &quot;Diary,&quot; records that &quot;W. Hewer this day went to see how his mother did, and comes home late, telling us how he hath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in Pye Corner being burned; so that the fire is got so far that way.&quot; The figure of a fat naked boy stands over a public house at the corner of the lane; it used to have the following warning inscription attached:\u2014 &quot;This boy is in memory put up of the late fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony, 1666.&quot; According to Stow, Pie Corner derived its name from the sign of a well-frequented hostelry, which anciently stood on the spot. Strype makes honourable mention of Pie Corner, as &quot;noted chiefly for cooks' shops and pigs dressed there during Bartholomew Fair.&quot; Our old writers have many references\u2014and not all, by the way, in the best taste\u2014to its cookstalls and dressed pork. Shadwell, for instance, in the Woman Captain (1680) speaks of &quot;meat dressed at Pie Corner by greasy scullions;&quot; and Ben Jonson writes in the Alchemist (1612)\u2014\n\n&quot;I shall put you in mind, sir, at Pie Corner,\nTaking your meal of steam in from cooks' stalls.&quot;\n\nAnd in &quot;The Great Boobee&quot; (&quot;Roxburgh Ballads&quot;):\n\n&quot;Next day I through Pie Corner passed;\nThe roast meat on the stall\nInvited me to take a taste;\nMy money was but small.&quot;\n\nBut Pie Corner seems to have been noted for more than eatables. A ballad from Tom D'Urfey's &quot;Pills to Purge Melancholy,&quot; describing Bartholomew Fair, eleven years before the Fire of London, says:\u2014\n\n&quot;At Pie-Corner end, mark well my good friend,\n'Tis a very fine dirty place;\nWhere there's more arrows and bows. \u2026\nThan was handled at Chivy Chase.&quot;\n\nWe have already given a view of Pie Corner in our chapter on Smithfield, page 361.\n\nHosier Lane, running from Cow Lane to Smithfield, and almost parallel to Cock Lane, is described by &quot;R. B.,&quot; in Strype, as a place not over-well built or inhabited. The houses were all old timber erections. Some of these\u2014those standing at the south corner of the lane\u2014were in the beginning of this century depicted by Mr. J. T. Smith, in his &quot;Ancient Topography of London.&quot; He describes them as probably of the reign of James I. The rooms were small, with low, unornamented ceilings; the timber, oak, profusely used; the gables were plain, and the walls lath and plaster. They were taken down in 1809.\n\nIn the corner house, in Mr. Smith's time, there was a barber whose name was Catchpole; at least, so it was written over the door. He was rather an odd fellow, and possessed, according to his own account, a famous relic of antiquity. He would gravely show his customers a short-bladed instrument, as the identical dagger with which Walworth killed Wat Tyler.\n\nHosier Lane, like Pie Corner, used to be a great resort during the time of Bartholomew Fair, &quot;all the houses,&quot; it is said in Strype, &quot;generally being made public for tippling.&quot;\n\nWe return now from our excursion to the north of St. Sepulchre's, and continue our rambles to the west, and before speaking of what is, let us refer to what has been.\n\nTurnagain Lane is not far from this. &quot;Near unto this Seacoal Lane,&quot; remarks Stow, &quot;in the turning towards Holborn Conduit, is Turnagain Lane, or rather, as in a record of the 5th of Edward III., Windagain Lane, for that it goeth down west to Fleet Dyke, from whence men must turn again the same way they came, but there it stopped.&quot; There used to be a proverb, &quot;He must take him a house in Turnagain Lane.&quot;\n\nA conduit formerly stood on Snow Hill, a little below the church. It is described as a building with four equal sides, ornamented with four columns and pediment, surmounted by a pyramid, on which stood a lamb\u2014a rebus on the name of Lamb, from whose conduit in Red Lion Street the water came. There had been a conduit there, however, before Lamb's day, which was towards the close of the sixteenth century.\n\nAt No. 37, King Street, Snow Hill, there used to be a ladies' charity school, which was established in 1702, and remained in the parish 145 years. Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale were subscribers to this school, and Johnson drew from it his story of Betty Broom, in &quot;The Idler.&quot; The world of domestic service, in Betty's days, seems to have been pretty much as now. Betty was a poor girl, bred in the country at a charity-school, maintained by the contributions of wealthy neighbours. The patronesses visited the school from time to time, to see how the pupils got on, and everything went well, till &quot;at last, the chief of the subscribers having passed a winter in London, came down full of an opinion new and strange to the whole country. She held it little less than criminal to teach poor girls to read and write. They who are born to poverty, she said, are born to ignorance, and will work the harder the less they know. She told her friends that London was in confusion by the insolence of servants; that scarcely a girl could be got for all-work, since education had made such numbers of fine ladies, that nobody would now accept a lower title than that of a waiting-maid, or something that might qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles, and to sit at work in the parlour window. But she was resolved, for her part, to spoil no more girls. Those who were to live by their hands should neither read nor write out of her pocket. The world was bad enough already, and she would have no part in making it worse.\n\n&quot;She was for a long time warmly opposed; but she persevered in her notions, and withdrew her subscription. Few listen, without a desire of conviction, to those who advise them to spare their money. Her example and her arguments gained ground daily; and in less than a year the whole parish was convinced that the nation would be ruined if the children of the poor were taught to read and write.&quot; So the school was dissolved, and Betty with the rest was turned adrift into the wide and cold world; and her adventures there any one may read in &quot;The Idler&quot; for himself.\n\nThere is an entry in the school minutes of 1763, to the effect that the ladies of the committee censured the schoolmistress for listening to the story of the Cock Lane ghost, and &quot;desired her to keep her belief in the article to herself.&quot;\n\nSkinner Street\u2014now one of the names of the past\u2014which ran by the south side of St. Sepulchre's, and formed the connecting link between Newgate Street and Holborn, received its name from Alderman Skinner, through whose exertions, about 1802, it was principally built. The following account of Skinner Street is from the picturesque pen of Mr. William Harvey (&quot;Aleph&quot;), whose long familiarity with the places he describes renders doubly valuable his many contributions to the history of London scenes and people:\u2014&quot;As a building speculation,&quot; he says, writing in 1863, &quot;it was a failure. When the buildings were ready for occupation, tall and substantial as they really were, the high rents frightened intending shopkeepers. Tenants were not to be had; and in order to get over the money difficulty, a lottery, sanctioned by Parliament, was commenced. Lotteries were then common tricks of finance, and nobody wondered at the new venture; but even the most desperate fortune-hunters were slow to invest their capital, and the tickets hung sadly on hand. The day for the drawing was postponed several times, and when it came, there was little or no excitement on the subject, and whoever rejoiced in becoming a house-owner on such easy terms, the original projectors and builders were understood to have suffered considerably. The winners found the property in a very unfinished condition. Few of the dwellings were habitable, and as funds were often wanting, a majority of the houses remained empty, and the shops unopened. After two or three years things began to improve; the vast many-storeyed house which then covered the site of Commercial Place was converted into a warehousing dep\u00f4t; a capital house opposite the 'Saracen's Head' was taken by a hosier of the name of Theobald, who, opening his shop with the determination of selling the best hosiery, and nothing else, was able to convince the citizens that his hose was first-rate, and, desiring only a living profit, succeeded, after thirty years of unwearied industry, in accumulating a large fortune. Theobald was possessed of literary tastes, and at the sale of Sir Walter Scott's manuscripts was a liberal purchaser. He also collected a library of exceedingly choice books, and when aristocratic customers purchased stockings of him, was soon able to interest them in matters of far higher interest\u2026\n\n&quot;The most remarkable shop\u2014but it was on the left-hand side, at a corner house\u2014was that established for the sale of children's books. It boasted an immense extent of window-front, extending from the entrance into Snow Hill, and towards Fleet Market. Many a time have I lingered with loving eyes over those fascinating story-books, so rich in gaily-coloured prints; such careful editions of the marvellous old histories, 'Puss in Boots,' 'Cock Robin,' 'Cinderella,' and the like. Fortunately the front was kept low, so as exactly to suit the capacity of a childish admirer. . . . . But Skinner Street did not prosper much, and never could compete with even the dullest portions of Holborn. I have spoken of some reputable shops; but you know the proverb, 'One swallow will not make a summer,' and it was a declining neighbourhood almost before it could be called new. In 1810 the commercial dep\u00f4t, which had been erected at a cost of \u00a325,000, and was the chief prize in the lottery, was destroyed by fire, never to be rebuilt\u2014a heavy blow and discouragement to Skinner Street, from which it never rallied. Perhaps the periodical hanging-days exercised an unfavourable influence, collecting, as they frequently did, all the thieves and vagabonds of London. I never sympathised with Pepys or Charles Fox in their passion for public executions, and made it a point to avoid those ghastly sights; but early of a Monday morning, when I had just reached the end of Giltspur Street, a miserable wretch had just been turned off from the platform of the debtors' door, and I was made the unwilling witness of his last struggles. That scene haunted me for months, and I often used to ask myself, 'Who that could help it would live in Skinner Street?' The next unpropitious event in these parts was the unexpected closing of the child's library. What could it mean? Such a well-to-do establishment shut up? Yes, the whole army of shutters looked blankly on the inquirer, and forbade even a single glance at 'Sinbad' or 'Robinson Crusoe.' It would soon be re-opened, we naturally thought; but the shutters never came down again. The whole house was deserted; not even a messenger in bankruptcy, or an ancient Charley, was found to regard the playful double knocks of the neighbouring juveniles. Gradually the glass of all the windows got broken in, a heavy cloud of black dust, solidifying into inches thick, gathered on sills and doors and brickwork, till the whole frontage grew as gloomy as Giant Despair's Castle. Not long after, the adjoining houses shared the same fate, and they remained from year to year without the slightest sign of life\u2014absolute scarecrows, darkening with their uncomfortable shadows the busy streets. Within half a mile, in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, there are (1863) seven houses in a similar predicament\u2014 window-glass demolished, doors cracked from top to bottom, spiders' webs hanging from every projecting sill or parapet. What can it mean? The loss in the article of rents alone must be over \u00a31,000 annually. If the real owners are at feud with imaginary owners, surely the property might be rendered valuable, and the proceeds invested. Even the lawyers can derive no profit from such hopeless abandonment. I am told the whole mischief arose out of a Chancery suit. Can it be the famous 'Jarndyce v. Jarndyce' case? And have all the heirs starved each other out? If so, what hinders our lady the Queen from taking possession? Any change would be an improvement, for these dead houses make the streets they cumber as dispiriting and comfortless as graveyards. Busy fancy will sometimes people them, and fill the dreary rooms with strange guests. Do the victims of guilt congregate in these dark dens? Do wretches 'unfriended by the world or the world's law,' seek refuge in these deserted nooks, mourning in the silence of despair over their former lives, and anticipating the future in unappeasable agony? Such things have been\u2014the silence and desolation of these doomed dwellings make them the more suitable for such tenants.&quot;\n\nA street is nothing without a mystery, so a mystery let these old tumble-down houses remain, whilst we go on to tell that, in front of No. 58, the sailor Cashman was hung in 1817, as we have already mentioned, for plundering a gunsmith's shop there. William Godwin, the author of &quot;Caleb Williams,&quot; kept a bookseller's shop for several years in Skinner Street, at No. 41, and published school-books in the name of Edward Baldwin. On the wall there was a stone carving of \u00c6sop reciting one of his fables to children.\n\nThe most noteworthy event of the life of Godwin was his marriage with the celebrated Mary Wollstonecraft, authoress of a &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women,&quot; whose congenial mind, in politics and morals, he ardently admired. Godwin's account of the way in which they got on together is worth reading:\u2014&quot;Ours,&quot; he writes, &quot;was not an idle happiness, a paradise of selfish and transitory pleasures. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to mention, that influenced by ideas I had long entertained, I engaged an apartment about twenty doors from our house, in the Polygon, Somers Town, which I designed for the purpose of my study and literary occupations. Trifles, however, will be interesting to some readers, when they relate to the last period of the life of such a person as Mary. I will add, therefore, that we were both of us of opinion, that it was possible for two persons to be too uniformly in each other's society. Influenced by that opinion, it was my practice to repair to the apartment I have mentioned as soon as I rose, and frequently not to make my appearance in the Polygon till the hour of dinner. We agreed in condemning the notion, prevalent in many situations in life, that a man and his wife cannot visit in mixed society but in company with each other, and we rather sought occasions of deviating from than of complying with this rule. By this means, though, for the most part, we spent the latter half of each day in one another's society, yet we were in no danger of satiety. We seemed to combine, in a considerable degree, the novelty and lively sensation of a visit with the more delicious and heartfelt pleasure of a domestic life.&quot;\n\nThis philosophic union, to Godwin's inexpressible affliction, did not last more than eighteen months, at the end of which time Mrs. Godwin died, leaving an only daughter, who in the course of time became the second wife of the poet Shelley, and was the author of the wild and extraordinary tale of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116<\/a>"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Jelltex","count_faves":"5","count_comments":"0","can_comment":0,"permissions":{"permcomment":1},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":67,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":160,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":213,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":333,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":427,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":533,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/8276\/15756507786_06f2a31935_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":683,"pathalias":"jelltecks"},{"id":"15596141429","owner":"16105638@N00","secret":"c03f873b95","server":"5602","farm":6,"title":"St Sepulchre Without Newgate, City of London","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"With the rain falling harder, it was a bit of a route march to Holborn and my next church, the stunning St Sepulchre, which was also open.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSt Sepulchre-without-Newgate, also known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Holborn), is an Anglican church in the City of London. It is located on Holborn Viaduct, almost opposite the Old Bailey. In medieval times it stood just outside (&quot;without&quot;) the now-demolished old city wall, near the Newgate. It has been a living of St John's College, Oxford, since 1622.\n\nThe original Saxon church on the site was dedicated to St Edmund the King and Martyr. During the Crusades in the 12th century the church was renamed St Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, in reference to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The name eventually became contracted to St Sepulchre.\n\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the City. It was completely rebuilt in the 15th century but was gutted by the Great Fire of London in 1666,[1] which left only the outer walls, the tower and the porch standing[2] -. Modified in the 18th century, the church underwent extensive restoration in 1878. It narrowly avoided destruction in the Second World War, although the 18th-century watch-house in its churchyard (erected to deter grave-robbers) was completely destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a coffered ceiling[3] installed in 1834. The Vicars' old residence has recently been renovated into a modern living quarter.\n\nDuring the reign of Mary I in 1555, St Sepulchre's vicar, John Rogers, was burned as a heretic.\n\nSt Sepulchre is named in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons as the &quot;bells of Old Bailey&quot;. Traditionally, the great bell would be rung to mark the execution of a prisoner at the nearby gallows at Newgate. The clerk of St Sepulchre's was also responsible for ringing a handbell outside the condemned man's cell in Newgate Prison to inform him of his impending execution. This handbell, known as the Execution Bell, now resides in a glass case to the south of the nave.\n\nThe church has been the official musicians' church for many years and is associated with many famous musicians. Its north aisle (formerly a chapel dedicated to Stephen Harding) is dedicated as the Musicians' Chapel, with four windows commemorating John Ireland, the singer Dame Nellie Melba, Walter Carroll and the conductor Sir Henry Wood respectively.[4] Wood, who &quot;at the age of fourteen, learned to play the organ&quot; at this church [1] and later became its organist, also has his ashes buried in this church.\n\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.[5] The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the City of London Rifles (the 6th Battalion London Regiment). The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate<\/a>\n\nThe Early History of St. Sepulchre's\u2014Its Destruction in 1666\u2014The Exterior and Interior\u2014The Early Popularity of the Church\u2014Interments here\u2014Roger Ascham, the Author of the &quot;Schoolmaster&quot;\u2014Captain John Smith, and his Romantic Adventures\u2014Saved by an Indian Girl\u2014 St. Sepulchre's Churchyard\u2014Accommodation for a Murderess\u2014The Martyr Rogers\u2014An Odd Circumstance\u2014Good Company for the Dead\u2014A Leap from the Tower\u2014A Warning Bell and a Last Admonition\u2014Nosegays for the Condemned\u2014The Route to the Gallows-tree\u2014 The Deeds of the Charitable\u2014The &quot;Saracen's Head&quot;\u2014Description by Dickens\u2014Giltspur Street\u2014Giltspur Street Compter\u2014A Disreputable Condition\u2014Pie Corner\u2014Hosier Lane\u2014A Spurious Relic\u2014The Conduit on Snow Hill\u2014A Ladies' Charity School\u2014Turnagain Lane\u2014Poor Betty!\u2014A Schoolmistress Censured\u2014Skinner Street\u2014Unpropitious Fortune\u2014William Godwin\u2014An Original Married Life.\n\nMany interesting associations\u2014Principally, however, connected with the annals of crime and the execution of the laws of England\u2014belong to the Church of St. Sepulchre, or St. 'Pulchre. This sacred edifice\u2014anciently known as St. Sepulchre's in the Bailey, or by Chamberlain Gate (now Newgate)\u2014stands at the eastern end of the slight acclivity of Snow Hill, and between Smithfield and the Old Bailey. The genuine materials for its early history are scanty enough. It was probably founded about the commencement of the twelfth century, but of the exact date and circumstances of its origin there is no record whatever. Its name is derived from the Holy Sepulchre of our Saviour at Jerusalem, to the memory of which it was first dedicated.\n\nThe earliest authentic notice of the church, according to Maitland, is of the year 1178, at which date it was given by Roger, Bishop of Sarum, to the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew. These held the right of advowson until the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., and from that time until 1610 it remained in the hands of the Crown. James I., however, then granted &quot;the rectory and its appurtenances, with the advowson of the vicarage,&quot; to Francis Phillips and others. The next stage in its history is that the rectory was purchased by the parishioners, to be held in fee-farm of the Crown, and the advowson was obtained by the President and Fellows of St. John the Baptist College, at Oxford.\n\nThe church was rebuilt about the middle of the fifteenth century, when one of the Popham family, who had been Chancellor of Normandy and Treasurer of the King's Household, with distinguished liberality erected a handsome chapel on the south side of the choir, and the very beautiful porch still remaining at the south-west corner of the building. &quot;His image,&quot; Stow says, &quot;fair graven in stone, was fixed over the said porch.&quot;\n\nThe dreadful fire of 1666 almost destroyed St. Sepulchre's, but the parishioners set energetically to work, and it was &quot;rebuilt and beautified both within and without.&quot; The general reparation was under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, and nothing but the walls of the old building, and these not entirely, were suffered to remain. The work was done rapidly, and the whole was completed within four years.\n\n&quot;The tower,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;retained its original aspect, and the body of the church, after its restoration, presented a series of windows between buttresses, with pointed heads filled with tracery, crowned by a string-course and battlements. In this form it remained till the year 1790, when it appears the whole fabric was found to be in a state of great decay, and it was resolved to repair it throughout. Accordingly the walls of the church were cased with Portland stone, and all the windows were taken out and replaced by others with plain semi-circular heads, as now seen\u2014certainly agreeing but badly with the tower and porch of the building, but according with the then prevailing spirit of economy. The battlements, too, were taken down, and a plain stone parapet was substituted, so that at this time (with the exception of the roof, which was wagon-headed, and presented on the outside an unsightly swell, visible above the parapet) the church assumed its present appearance.&quot; The ungainly roof was removed, and an entirely new one erected, about 1836.\n\nAt each corner of the tower\u2014&quot;one of the most ancient,&quot; says the author of &quot;Londinium Redivivum,&quot; &quot;in the outline of the circuit of London&quot; \u2014there are spires, and on the spires there are weathercocks. These have been made use of by Howell to point a moral: &quot;Unreasonable people,&quot; says he, &quot;are as hard to reconcile as the vanes of St. Sepulchre's tower, which never look all four upon one point of the heavens.&quot; Nothing can be said with certainty as to the date of the tower, but it is not without the bounds of probability that it formed part of the original building. The belfry is reached by a small winding staircase in the south-west angle, and a similar staircase in an opposite angle leads to the summit. The spires at the corners, and some of the tower windows, have very recently undergone several alterations, which have added much to the picturesqueness and beauty of the church.\n\nThe chief entrance to St. Sepulchre's is by a porch of singular beauty, projecting from the south side of the tower, at the western end of the church. The groining of the ceiling of this porch, it has been pointed out, takes an almost unique form; the ribs are carved in bold relief, and the bosses at the intersections represent angels' heads, shields, roses, &amp;c., in great variety.\n\nComing now to the interior of the church, we find it divided into three aisles, by two ranges of Tuscan columns. The aisles are of unequal widths, that in the centre being the widest, that to the south the narrowest. Semi-circular arches connect the columns on either side, springing directly from their capitals, without the interposition of an entablature, and support a large dental cornice, extending round the church. The ceiling of the middle aisle is divided into seven compartments, by horizontal bands, the middle compartment being formed into a small dome.\n\nThe aisles have groined ceilings, ornamented at the angles with doves, &amp;c., and beneath every division of the groining are small windows, to admit light to the galleries. Over each of the aisles there is a gallery, very clumsily introduced, which dates from the time when the church was built by Wren, and extends the whole length, excepting at the chancel. The front of the gallery, which is of oak, is described by Mr. Godwin as carved into scrolls, branches, &amp;c., in the centre panel, on either side, with the initials &quot;C. R.,&quot; enriched with carvings of laurel, which have, however, he says, &quot;but little merit.&quot;\n\nAt the east end of the church there are three semicircular-headed windows. Beneath the centre one is a large Corinthian altar-piece of oak, displaying columns, entablatures, &amp;c., elaborately carved and gilded.\n\nThe length of the church, exclusive of the ambulatory, is said to be 126 feet, the breadth 68 feet, and the height of the tower 140 feet.\n\nA singularly ugly sounding-board, extending over the preacher, used to stand at the back of the pulpit, at the east end of the church. It was in the shape of a large parabolic reflector, about twelve feet in diameter, and was composed of ribs of mahogany.\n\nAt the west end of the church there is a large organ, said to be the oldest and one of the finest in London. It was built in 1677, and has been greatly enlarged. Its reed-stops (hautboy, clarinet, &amp;c.) are supposed to be unrivalled. In Newcourt's time the church was taken notice of as &quot;remarkable for possessing an exceedingly fine organ, and the playing is thought so beautiful, that large congregations are attracted, though some of the parishioners object to the mode of performing divine service.&quot;\n\nOn the north side of the church, Mr. Godwin mentions, is a large apartment known as &quot;St. Stephen's Chapel.&quot; This building evidently formed a somewhat important part of the old church, and was probably appropriated to the votaries of the saint whose name it bears.\n\nBetween the exterior and the interior of the church there is little harmony. &quot;For example,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;the columns which form the south aisle face, in some instances, the centre of the large windows which occur in the external wall of the church, and in others the centre of the piers, indifferently.&quot; This discordance may likely enough have arisen from the fact that when the church was rebuilt, or rather restored, after the Great Fire, the works were done without much attention from Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nSt. Sepulchre's appears to have enjoyed considerable popularity from the earliest period of its history, if one is to judge from the various sums left by well-disposed persons for the support of certain fraternities founded in the church\u2014namely, those of St. Katherine, St. Michael, St. Anne, and Our Lady\u2014and by others, for the maintenance of chantry priests to celebrate masses at stated intervals for the good of their souls. One of the fraternities just named\u2014that of St. Katherine\u2014 originated, according to Stow, in the devotion of some poor persons in the parish, and was in honour of the conception of the Virgin Mary. They met in the church on the day of the Conception, and there had the mass of the day, and offered to the same, and provided a certain chaplain daily to celebrate divine service, and to set up wax lights before the image belonging to the fraternity, on all festival days.\n\nThe most famous of all who have been interred in St. Sepulchre's is Roger Ascham, the author of the &quot;Schoolmaster,&quot; and the instructor of Queen Elizabeth in Greek and Latin. This learned old worthy was born in 1515, near Northallerton, in Yorkshire. He was educated at Cambridge University, and in time rose to be the university orator, being notably zealous in promoting what was then a novelty in England\u2014the study of the Greek language. To divert himself after the fatigue of severe study, he used to devote himself to archery. This drew down upon him the censure of the all-work-and-no-play school; and in defence of himself, Ascham, in 1545, published &quot;Toxophilus,&quot; a treatise on his favourite sport. This book is even yet well worthy of perusal, for its enthusiasm, and for its curious descriptions of the personal appearance and manners of the principal persons whom the author had seen and conversed with. Henry VIII. rewarded him with a pension of \u00a310 per annum, a considerable sum in those days. In 1548, Ascham, on the death of William Grindall, who had been his pupil, was appointed instructor in the learned languages to Lady Elizabeth, afterwards the good Queen Bess. At the end of two years he had some dispute with, or took a disgust at, Lady Elizabeth's attendants, resigned his situation, and returned to his college. Soon after this he was employed as secretary to the English ambassador at the court of Charles V. of Germany, and remained abroad till the death of Edward VI. During his absence he had been appointed Latin secretary to King Edward. Strangely enough, though Queen Mary and her ministers were Papists, and Ascham a Protestant, he was retained in his office of Latin secretary, his pension was increased to \u00a320, and he was allowed to retain his fellowship and his situation as university orator. In 1554 he married a lady of good family, by whom he had a considerable fortune, and of whom, in writing to a friend, he gives, as might perhaps be expected, an excellent character. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, she not only required his services as Latin secretary, but as her instructor in Greek, and he resided at Court during the remainder of his life. He died in consequence of his endeavours to complete a Latin poem which he intended to present to the queen on the New Year's Day of 1569. He breathed his last two days before 1568 ran out, and was interred, according to his own directions, in the most private manner, in St. Sepulchre's Church, his funeral sermon being preached by Dr. Andrew Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's. He was universally lamented; and even the queen herself not only showed great concern, but was pleased to say that she would rather have lost ten thousand pounds than her tutor Ascham, which, from that somewhat closehanded sovereign, was truly an expression of high regard.\n\nAscham, like most men, had his little weaknesses. He had too great a propensity to dice and cock-fighting. Bishop Nicholson would try to convince us that this is an unfounded calumny, but, as it is mentioned by Camden, and other contemporary writers, it seems impossible to deny it. He died, from all accounts, in indifferent circumstances. &quot;Whether,&quot; says Dr. Johnson, referring to this, &quot;Ascham was poor by his own fault, or the fault of others, cannot now be decided; but it is certain that many have been rich with less merit. His philological learning would have gained him honour in any country; and among us it may justly call for that reverence which all nations owe to those who first rouse them from ignorance, and kindle among them the light of literature.&quot; His most valuable work, &quot;The Schoolmaster,&quot; was published by his widow. The nature of this celebrated performance may be gathered from the title: &quot;The Schoolmaster; or a plain and perfite way of teaching children to understand, write, and speak the Latin tongue. \u2026 And commodious also for all such as have forgot the Latin tongue, and would by themselves, without a schoolmaster, in short time, and with small pains, recover a sufficient habilitie to understand, write, and speak Latin: by Roger Ascham, ann. 1570. At London, printed by John Daye, dwelling over Aldersgate,&quot; a printer, by the way, already mentioned by us a few chapters back (see page 208), as having printed several noted works of the sixteenth century.\n\nDr. Johnson remarks that the instruction recommended in &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot; is perhaps the best ever given for the study of languages.\n\nHere also lies buried Captain John Smith, a conspicuous soldier of fortune, whose romantic adventures and daring exploits have rarely been surpassed. He died on the 21st of June, 1631. This valiant captain was born at Willoughby, in the county of Lincoln, and helped by his doings to enliven the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. He had a share in the wars of Hungary in 1602, and in three single combats overcame three Turks, and cut off their heads. For this, and other equally brave deeds, Sigismund, Duke of Transylvania, gave him his picture set in gold, with a pension of three hundred ducats; and allowed him to bear three Turks' heads proper as his shield of arms. He afterwards went to America, where he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Indians. He escaped from them, however, at last, and resumed his brilliant career by hazarding his life in naval engagements with pirates and Spanish men-of-war. The most important act of his life was the share he had in civilising the natives of New England, and reducing that province to obedience to Great Britain. In connection with his tomb in St. Sepulchre's, he is mentioned by Stow, in his &quot;Survey,&quot; as &quot;some time Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New England.&quot;\n\nCertainly the most interesting events of his chequered career were his capture by the Indians, and the saving of his life by the Indian girl Pocahontas, a story of adventure that charms as often as it is told. Bancroft, the historian of the United States, relates how, during the early settlement of Virginia, Smith left the infant colony on an exploring expedition, and not only ascended the river Chickahominy, but struck into the interior. His companions disobeyed his instructions, and being surprised by the Indians, were put to death. Smith preserved his own life by calmness and self-possession. Displaying a pocket-compass, he amused the savages by an explanation of its power, and increased their admiration of his superior genius by imparting to them some vague conceptions of the form of the earth, and the nature of the planetary system. To the Indians, who retained him as their prisoner, his captivity was a more strange event than anything of which the traditions of their tribes preserved the memory. He was allowed to send a letter to the fort at Jamestown, and the savage wonder was increased, for he seemed by some magic to endow the paper with the gift of intelligence. It was evident that their captive was a being of a high order, and then the question arose, Was his nature beneficent, or was he to be dreaded as a dangerous enemy? Their minds were bewildered, and the decision of his fate was referred to the chief Powhatan, and before Powhatan Smith was brought. &quot;The fears of the feeble aborigines,&quot; says Bancroft, &quot;were about to prevail, and his immediate death, already repeatedly threatened and repeatedly delayed, would have been inevitable, but for the timely intercession of Pocahontas, a girl twelve years old, the daughter of Powhatan, whose confiding fondness Smith had easily won, and who firmly clung to his neck, as his head was bowed down to receive the stroke of the tomahawks. His fearlessness, and her entreaties, persuaded the council to spare the agreeable stranger, who could make hatchets for her father, and rattles and strings of beads for herself, the favourite child. The barbarians, whose decision had long been held in suspense by the mysterious awe which Smith had inspired, now resolved to receive him as a friend, and to make him a partner of their councils. They tempted him to join their bands, and lend assistance in an attack upon the white men at Jamestown; and when his decision of character succeeded in changing the current of their thoughts, they dismissed him with mutual promises of friendship and benevolence. Thus the captivity of Smith did itself become a benefit to the colony; for he had not only observed with care the country between the James and the Potomac, and had gained some knowledge of the language and manners of the natives, but he now established a peaceful intercourse between the English and the tribes of Powhatan.&quot;\n\nOn the monument erected to Smith in St. Sepulchre's Church, the following quaint lines were formerly inscribed:\u2014\n\n&quot;Here lies one conquered that hath conquered kings,\nSubdued large territories, and done things\nWhich to the world impossible would seem,\nBut that the truth is held in more esteem.\nShall I report his former service done,\nIn honour of his God, and Christendom?\nHow that he did divide, from pagans three,\nTheir heads and lives, types of his chivalry?\u2014\nFor which great service, in that climate done,\nBrave Sigismundus, King of Hungarion,\nDid give him, as a coat of arms, to wear\nThese conquered heads, got by his sword and spear.\nOr shall I tell of his adventures since\nDone in Virginia, that large continent?\nHow that he subdued kings unto his yoke,\nAnd made those heathens flee, as wind doth smoke;\nAnd made their land, being so large a station,\nAn habitation for our Christian nation,\nWhere God is glorified, their wants supplied;\nWhich else for necessaries, must have died.\nBut what avails his conquests, now he lies\nInterred in earth, a prey to worms and flies?\nOh! may his soul in sweet Elysium sleep,\nUntil the Keeper, that all souls doth keep,\nReturn to judgment; and that after thence\nWith angels he may have his recompense.&quot;\n\nSir Robert Peake, the engraver, also found a last resting-place here. He is known as the master of William Faithorne\u2014the famous English engraver of the seventeenth century\u2014and governor of Basing House for the king during the Civil War under Charles I. He died in 1667. Here also was interred the body of Dr. Bell, grandfather of the originator of a well-known system of education.\n\n&quot;The churchyard of St. Sepulchre's,&quot; we learn from Maitland, &quot;at one time extended so far into the street on the south side of the church, as to render the passage-way dangerously narrow. In 1760 the churchyard was, in consequence, levelled, and thrown open to the public. But this led to much inconvenience, and it was re-enclosed in 1802.&quot;\n\nSarah Malcolm, the murderess, was buried in the churchyard of St. Sepulchre's in 1733. This coldhearted and keen-eyed monster in human form has had her story told by us already. The parishioners seem, on this occasion, to have had no such scruples as had been exhibited by their predecessors a hundred and fifty years previous at the burial of Awfield, a traitor. We shall see presently that in those more remote days they were desirous of having at least respectable company for their deceased relatives and friends in the churchyard.\n\n&quot;For a long period,&quot; says Mr. Godwin (1838), &quot;the church was surrounded by low mean buildings, by which its general appearance was hidden; but these having been cleared away, and the neighbourhood made considerably more open, St. Sepulchre's now forms a somewhat pleasing object, notwithstanding that the tower and a part of the porch are so entirely dissimilar in style to the remainder of the building.&quot; And since Godwin's writing the surroundings of the church have been so improved that perhaps few buildings in the metropolis stand more prominently before the public eye.\n\nIn the glorious roll of martyrs who have suffered at the stake for their religious principles, a vicar of St. Sepulchre's, the Reverend John Rogers, occupies a conspicuous place. He was the first who was burned in the reign of the Bloody Mary. This eminent person had at one time been chaplain to the English merchants at Antwerp, and while residing in that city had aided Tindal and Coverdale in their great work of translating the Bible. He married a German lady of good position, by whom he had a large family, and was enabled, by means of her relations, to reside in peace and safety in Germany. It appeared to be his duty, however, to return to England, and there publicly profess and advocate his religious convictions, even at the risk of death. He crossed the sea; he took his place in the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross; he preached a fearless and animated sermon, reminding his astonished audience of the pure and wholesome doctrine which had been promulgated from that pulpit in the days of the good King Edward, and solemnly warning them against the pestilent idolatry and superstition of these new times. It was his last sermon. He was apprehended, tried, condemned, and burned at Smithfield. We described, when speaking of Smithfield, the manner in which he met his fate.\n\nConnected with the martyrdom of Rogers an odd circumstance is quoted in the &quot;Churches of London.&quot; It is stated that when the bishops had resolved to put to death Joan Bocher, a friend came to Rogers and earnestly entreated his influence that the poor woman's life might be spared, and other means taken to prevent the spread of her heterodox doctrines. Rogers, however, contended that she should be executed; and his friend then begged him to choose some other kind of death, which should be more agreeable to the gentleness and mercy prescribed in the gospel. &quot;No,&quot; replied Rogers, &quot;burning alive is not a cruel death, but easy enough.&quot; His friend hearing these words, expressive of so little regard for the sufferings of a fellow-creature, answered him with great vehemence, at the same time striking Rogers' hand, &quot;Well, it may perhaps so happen that you yourself shall have your hands full of this mild burning.&quot; There is no record of Rogers among the papers belonging to St. Sepulchre's, but this may easily be accounted for by the fact that at the Great Fire of 1666 nearly all the registers and archives were destroyed.\n\nA noteworthy incident in the history of St. Sepulchre's was connected with the execution, in 1585, of Awfield, for &quot;sparcinge abrood certen lewed, sedicious, and traytorous bookes.&quot; &quot;When he was executed,&quot; says Fleetwood, the Recorder, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, July 7th of that year, &quot;his body was brought unto St. Pulcher's to be buryed, but the parishioners would not suffer a traytor's corpse to be laid in the earth where their parents, wives, children, kindred, masters, and old neighbours did rest; and so his carcass was returned to the burial-ground near Tyburn, and there I leave it.&quot;\n\nAnother event in the history of the church is a tale of suicide. On the 10th of April, 1600, a man named William Dorrington threw himself from the roof of the tower, leaving there a prayer for forgiveness.\n\nWe come now to speak of the connection of St. Sepulchre's with the neighbouring prison of Newgate. Being the nearest church to the prison, that connection naturally was intimate. Its clock served to give the time to the hangman when there was an execution in the Old Bailey, and many a poor wretch's last moments must it have regulated.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the altar a board with a list of charitable donations and gifts used to contain the following item:\u2014&quot;1605. Mr. Robert Dowe gave, for ringing the greatest bell in this church on the day the condemned prisoners are executed, and for other services, for ever, concerning such condemned prisoners, for which services the sexton is paid \u00a316s. 8d.\u2014\u00a350.\n\nIt was formerly the practice for the clerk or bellman of St. Sepulchre's to go under Newgate, on the night preceding the execution of a criminal, ring his bell, and repeat the following wholesome advice:\u2014\n\n&quot;All you that in the condemned hold do lie,\nPrepare you, for to-morrow you shall die;\nWatch all, and pray, the hour is drawing near\nThat you before the Almighty must appear;\nExamine well yourselves, in time repent,\nThat you may not to eternal flames be sent.\nAnd when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,\nThe Lord above have mercy on your souls.\nPast twelve o'clock!&quot;\n\nThis practice is explained by a passage in Munday's edition of Stow, in which it is told that a Mr. John Dowe, citizen and merchant taylor of London, gave \u00a350 to the parish church of St. Sepulchre's, under the following conditions:\u2014After the several sessions of London, on the night before the execution of such as were condemned to death, the clerk of the church was to go in the night-time, and also early in the morning, to the window of the prison in which they were lying. He was there to ring &quot;certain tolls with a hand-bell&quot; appointed for the purpose, and was afterwards, in a most Christian manner, to put them in mind of their present condition and approaching end, and to exhort them to be prepared, as they ought to be, to die. When they were in the cart, and brought before the walls of the church, the clerk was to stand there ready with the same bell, and, after certain tolls, rehearse a prayer, desiring all the people there present to pray for the unfortunate criminals. The beadle, also, of Merchant Taylors' Hall was allowed an &quot;honest stipend&quot; to see that this ceremony was regularly performed.\n\nThe affecting admonition\u2014&quot;affectingly good,&quot; Pennant calls it\u2014addressed to the prisoners in Newgate, on the night before execution, ran as follows:\u2014\n\n&quot;You prisoners that are within,\nWho, for wickedness and sin,\n\nafter many mercies shown you, are now appointed to die to-morrow in the forenoon; give ear and understand that, to-morrow morning, the greatest bell of St. Sepulchre's shall toll for you, in form and manner of a passing-bell, as used to be tolled for those that are at the point of death; to the end that all godly people, hearing that bell, and knowing it is for your going to your deaths, may be stirred up heartily to pray to God to bestow his grace and mercy upon you, whilst you live. I beseech you, for Jesus Christ's sake, to keep this night in watching and prayer, to the salvation of your own souls while there is yet time and place for mercy; as knowing to-morrow you must appear before the judgment-seat of your Creator, there to give an account of all things done in this life, and to suffer eternal torments for your sins committed against Him, unless, upon your hearty and unfeigned repentance, you find mercy through the merits, death, and passion of your only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return to Him.&quot;\n\nAnd the following was the admonition to condemned criminals, as they were passing by St. Sepulchre's Church wall to execution:\u2014&quot; All good people, pray heartily unto God for these poor sinners, who are now going to their death, for whom this great bell doth toll.\n\n&quot;You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask mercy of the Lord, for the salvation of your own souls, through the [merits, death, and passion of Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto Him.\n\n&quot;Lord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.\nLord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.&quot;\n\nThe charitable Mr. Dowe, who took such interest in the last moments of the occupants of the condemned cell, was buried in the church of St. Botolph, Aldgate.\n\nAnother curious custom observed at St. Sepulchre's was the presentation of a nosegay to every criminal on his way to execution at Tyburn. No doubt the practice had its origin in some kindly feeling for the poor unfortunates who were so soon to bid farewell to all the beauties of earth. One of the last who received a nosegay from the steps of St. Sepulchre's was &quot;Sixteen-string Jack,&quot; alias John Rann, who was hanged, in 1774, for robbing the Rev. Dr. Bell of his watch and eighteen pence in money, in Gunnersbury Lane, on the road to Brentford. Sixteen-string Jack wore the flowers in his button-hole as he rode dolefully to the gallows. This was witnessed by John Thomas Smith, who thus describes the scene in his admirable anecdotebook, &quot;Nollekens and his Times:&quot;\u2014&quot; I remember well, when I was in my eighth year, Mr. Nollekens calling at my father's house, in Great Portland Street, and taking us to Oxford Street, to see the notorious Jack Rann, commonly called Sixteenstring Jack, go to Tyburn to be hanged. \u2026 The criminal was dressed in a pea-green coat, with an immense nosegay in the button-hole, which had been presented to him at St. Sepulchre's steps; and his nankeen small-clothes, we were told, were tied at each knee with sixteen strings. After he had passed, and Mr. Nollekens was leading me home by the hand, I recollect his stooping down to me and observing, in a low tone of voice, 'Tom, now, my little man, if my father-in-law, Mr. Justice Welch, had been high constable, we could have walked by the side of the cart all the way to Tyburn.'&quot;\n\nWhen criminals were conveyed from Newgate to Tyburn, the cart passed up Giltspur Street, and through Smithfield, to Cow Lane. Skinner Street had not then been built, and the Crooked Lane which turned down by St. Sepulchre's, as well as Ozier Lane, did not afford sufficient width to admit of the cavalcade passing by either of them, with convenience, to Holborn Hill, or &quot;the Heavy Hill,&quot; as it used to be called. The procession seems at no time to have had much of the solemn element about it. &quot;The heroes of the day were often,&quot; says a popular writer, &quot;on good terms with the mob, and jokes were exchanged between the men who were going to be hanged and the men who deserved to be.&quot;\n\n&quot;On St. Paul's Day,&quot; says Mr. Timbs (1868), &quot;service is performed in St. Sepulchre's, in accordance with the will of Mr. Paul Jervis, who, in 1717, devised certain land in trust that a sermon should be preached in the church upon every Paul's Day upon the excellence of the liturgy o the Church of England; the preacher to receive 40s. for such sermon. Various sums are also bequeathed to the curate, the clerk, the treasurer, and masters of the parochial schools. To the poor of the parish he bequeathed 20s. a-piece to ten of the poorest householders within that part of the parish of St. Sepulchre commonly called Smithfield quarter, \u00a34 to the treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and 6s. 8d. yearly to the clerk, who shall attend to receive the same. The residue of the yearly rents and profits is to be distributed unto and amongst such poor people of the parish of St. Sepulchre's, London, who shall attend the service and sermon. At the close of the service the vestry-clerk reads aloud an extract from the will, and then proceeds to the distribution of the money. In the evening the vicar, churchwardens, and common councilmen of the precinct dine together.&quot;\n\nIn 1749, a Mr. Drinkwater made a praiseworthy bequest. He left the parish of St. Sepulchre \u00a3500 to be lent in sums of \u00a325 to industrious young tradesmen. No interest was to be charged, and the money was to be lent for four years.\n\nNext to St. Sepulchre's, on Snow Hill, used to stand the famous old inn of the &quot;Saracen's Head.&quot; It was only swept away within the last few years by the ruthless army of City improvers: a view of it in course of demolition was given on page 439. It was one of the oldest of the London inns which bore the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; for a sign. One of Dick Tarlton's jests makes mention of the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; without Newgate, and Stow, describing this neighbourhood, speaks particularly of &quot;a fair large inn for receipt of travellers&quot; that &quot;hath to sign the 'Saracen's Head.'&quot; The courtyard had, to the last, many of the characteristics of an old English inn; there were galleries all round leading to the bedrooms, and a spacious gateway through which the dusty mail-coaches used to rumble, the tired passengers creeping forth &quot;thanking their stars in having escaped the highwaymen and the holes and sloughs of the road.&quot; Into that courtyard how many have come on their first arrival in London with hearts beating high with hope, some of whom have risen to be aldermen and sit in state as lord mayor, whilst others have gone the way of the idle apprentice and come to a sad end at Tyburn! It was at this inn that Nicholas Nickleby and his uncle waited upon the Yorkshire schoolmaster Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall. Mr. Dickens describes the tavern as it existed in the last days of mail-coaching, when it was a most important place for arrivals and departures in London:\u2014\n\n&quot;Next to the jail, and by consequence near to Smithfield also, and the Compter and the bustle and noise of the City, and just on that particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastwards seriously think of falling down on purpose, and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westwards not unfrequently fall by accident, is the coach-yard of the 'Saracen's Head' inn, its portals guarded by two Saracen's heads and shoulders, which it was once the pride and glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night, but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity, possibly because this species of humour is now confined to St. James's parish, where doorknockers are preferred as being more portable, and bell-wires esteemed as convenient tooth-picks. Whether this be the reason or not, there they are, frowning upon you from each side of the gateway; and the inn itself, garnished with another Saracen's head, frowns upon you from the top of the yard; while from the door of the hind-boot of all the red coaches that are standing therein, there glares a small Saracen's head with a twin expression to the large Saracen's head below, so that the general appearance of the pile is of the Saracenic order.&quot;\n\nTo explain the use of the Saracen's head as an inn sign various reasons have been given. &quot;When our countrymen,&quot; says Selden, &quot;came home from fighting with the Saracens and were beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible faces (as you still see the 'Saracen's Head' is), when in truth they were like other men. But this they did to save their own credit.&quot; Or the sign may have been adopted by those who had visited the Holy Land either as pilgrims or to fight the Saracens. Others, again, hold that it was first set up in compliment to the mother of Thomas \u00e0 Becket, who was the daughter of a Saracen. However this may be, it is certain that the use of the sign in former days was very general.\n\nRunning past the east end of St. Sepulchre's, from Newgate into West Smithfield, is Giltspur Street, anciently called Knightriders Street. This interesting thoroughfare derives its name from the knights with their gilt spurs having been accustomed to ride this way to the jousts and tournaments which in days of old were held in Smithfield.\n\nIn this street was Giltspur Street Compter, a debtors' prison and house of correction appertaining to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex. It stood over against St. Sepulchre's Church, and was removed hither from the east side of Wood Street, Cheapside, in 1791. At the time of its removal it was used as a place of imprisonment for debtors, but the yearly increasing demands upon the contracted space caused that department to be given up, and City debtors were sent to Whitecross Street. The architect was Dance, to whom we are also indebted for the grim pile of Newgate. The Compter was a dirty and appropriately convictlooking edifice. It was pulled down in 1855. Mr. Hepworth Dixon gave an interesting account of this City House of Correction, not long before its demolition, in his &quot;London Prisons&quot; (1850). &quot;Entering,&quot; he says, &quot;at the door facing St. Sepulchre's, the visitor suddenly finds himself in a low dark passage, leading into the offices of the gaol, and branching off into other passages, darker, closer, more replete with noxious smells, than even those of Newgate. This is the fitting prelude to what follows. The prison, it must be noticed, is divided into two principal divisions, the House of Correction and the Compter. The front in Giltspur Street, and the side nearest to Newgate Street, is called the Compter. In its wards are placed detenues of various kinds\u2014remands, committals from the police-courts, and generally persons waiting for trial, and consequently still unconvicted. The other department, the House of Correction, occupies the back portion of the premises, abutting on Christ's Hospital. Curious it is to consider how thin a wall divides these widely-separate worlds! And sorrowful it is to think what a difference of destiny awaits the children\u2014destiny inexorable, though often unearned in either case\u2014who, on the one side of it or the other, receive an eleemosynary education! The collegian and the criminal! Who shall say how much mere accident\u2014 circumstances over which the child has little power \u2014determines to a life of usefulness or mischief? From the yards of Giltspur Street prison almost the only objects visible, outside of the gaol itself, are the towers of Christ's Hospital; the only sounds audible, the shouts of the scholars at their play. The balls of the hospital boys often fall within the yards of the prison. Whether these sights and sounds ever cause the criminal to pause and reflect upon the courses of his life, we will not say, but the stranger visiting the place will be very apt to think for him. \u2026\n\n&quot;In the department of the prison called the House of Correction, minor offenders within the City of London are imprisoned. No transports are sent hither, nor is any person whose sentence is above three years in length.&quot; This able writer then goes on to tell of the many crying evils connected with the institution\u2014the want of air, the over-crowded state of the rooms, the absence of proper cellular accommodation, and the vicious intercourse carried on amongst the prisoners. The entire gaol, when he wrote, only contained thirty-six separate sleeping-rooms. Now by the highest prison calculation\u2014and this, be it noted, proceeds on the assumption that three persons can sleep in small, miserable, unventilated cells, which are built for only one, and are too confined for that, being only about one-half the size of the model cell for one at Pentonville\u2014it was only capable of accommodating 203 prisoners, yet by the returns issued at Michaelmas, 1850, it contained 246!\n\nA large section of the prison used to be devoted to female delinquents, but lately it was almost entirely given up to male offenders.\n\n&quot;The House of Correction, and the Compter portion of the establishment,&quot; says Mr. Dixon, &quot;are kept quite distinct, but it would be difficult to award the palm of empire in their respective facilities for demoralisation. We think the Compter rather the worse of the two. You are shown into a room, about the size of an apartment in an ordinary dwelling-house, which will be found crowded with from thirty to forty persons, young and old, and in their ordinary costume; the low thief in his filth and rags, and the member of the swell-mob with his bright buttons, flash finery, and false jewels. Here you notice the boy who has just been guilty of his first offence, and committed for trial, learning with a greedy mind a thousand criminal arts, and listening with the precocious instinct of guilty passions to stories and conversations the most depraved and disgusting. You regard him with a mixture of pity and loathing, for he knows that the eyes of his peers are upon him, and he stares at you with a familiar impudence, and exhibits a devil-may-care countenance, such as is only to be met with in the juvenile offender. Here, too, may be seen the young clerk, taken up on suspicion\u2014perhaps innocent\u2014who avoids you with a shy look of pain and uneasiness: what a hell must this prison be to him! How frightful it is to think of a person really untainted with crime, compelled to herd for ten or twenty days with these abandoned wretches!\n\n&quot;On the other, the House of Correction side of the gaol, similar rooms will be found, full of prisoners communicating with each other, laughing and shouting without hindrance. All this is so little in accordance with existing notions of prison discipline, that one is continually fancying these disgraceful scenes cannot be in the capital of England, and in the year of grace 1850. Very few of the prisoners attend school or receive any instruction; neither is any kind of employment afforded them, except oakum-picking, and the still more disgusting labour of the treadmill. When at work, an officer is in attendance to prevent disorderly conduct; but his presence is of no avail as a protection to the less depraved. Conversation still goes on; and every facility is afforded for making acquaintances, and for mutual contamination.&quot;\n\nAfter having long been branded by intelligent inspectors as a disgrace to the metropolis, Giltspur Street Compter was condemned, closed in 1854, and subsequently taken down.\n\nNearly opposite what used to be the site of the Compter, and adjoining Cock Lane, is the spot called Pie Corner, near which terminated the Great Fire of 1666. The fire commenced at Pudding Lane, it will be remembered, so it was singularly appropriate that it should terminate at Pie Corner. Under the date of 4th September, 1666, Pepys, in his &quot;Diary,&quot; records that &quot;W. Hewer this day went to see how his mother did, and comes home late, telling us how he hath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in Pye Corner being burned; so that the fire is got so far that way.&quot; The figure of a fat naked boy stands over a public house at the corner of the lane; it used to have the following warning inscription attached:\u2014 &quot;This boy is in memory put up of the late fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony, 1666.&quot; According to Stow, Pie Corner derived its name from the sign of a well-frequented hostelry, which anciently stood on the spot. Strype makes honourable mention of Pie Corner, as &quot;noted chiefly for cooks' shops and pigs dressed there during Bartholomew Fair.&quot; Our old writers have many references\u2014and not all, by the way, in the best taste\u2014to its cookstalls and dressed pork. Shadwell, for instance, in the Woman Captain (1680) speaks of &quot;meat dressed at Pie Corner by greasy scullions;&quot; and Ben Jonson writes in the Alchemist (1612)\u2014\n\n&quot;I shall put you in mind, sir, at Pie Corner,\nTaking your meal of steam in from cooks' stalls.&quot;\n\nAnd in &quot;The Great Boobee&quot; (&quot;Roxburgh Ballads&quot;):\n\n&quot;Next day I through Pie Corner passed;\nThe roast meat on the stall\nInvited me to take a taste;\nMy money was but small.&quot;\n\nBut Pie Corner seems to have been noted for more than eatables. A ballad from Tom D'Urfey's &quot;Pills to Purge Melancholy,&quot; describing Bartholomew Fair, eleven years before the Fire of London, says:\u2014\n\n&quot;At Pie-Corner end, mark well my good friend,\n'Tis a very fine dirty place;\nWhere there's more arrows and bows. \u2026\nThan was handled at Chivy Chase.&quot;\n\nWe have already given a view of Pie Corner in our chapter on Smithfield, page 361.\n\nHosier Lane, running from Cow Lane to Smithfield, and almost parallel to Cock Lane, is described by &quot;R. B.,&quot; in Strype, as a place not over-well built or inhabited. The houses were all old timber erections. Some of these\u2014those standing at the south corner of the lane\u2014were in the beginning of this century depicted by Mr. J. T. Smith, in his &quot;Ancient Topography of London.&quot; He describes them as probably of the reign of James I. The rooms were small, with low, unornamented ceilings; the timber, oak, profusely used; the gables were plain, and the walls lath and plaster. They were taken down in 1809.\n\nIn the corner house, in Mr. Smith's time, there was a barber whose name was Catchpole; at least, so it was written over the door. He was rather an odd fellow, and possessed, according to his own account, a famous relic of antiquity. He would gravely show his customers a short-bladed instrument, as the identical dagger with which Walworth killed Wat Tyler.\n\nHosier Lane, like Pie Corner, used to be a great resort during the time of Bartholomew Fair, &quot;all the houses,&quot; it is said in Strype, &quot;generally being made public for tippling.&quot;\n\nWe return now from our excursion to the north of St. Sepulchre's, and continue our rambles to the west, and before speaking of what is, let us refer to what has been.\n\nTurnagain Lane is not far from this. &quot;Near unto this Seacoal Lane,&quot; remarks Stow, &quot;in the turning towards Holborn Conduit, is Turnagain Lane, or rather, as in a record of the 5th of Edward III., Windagain Lane, for that it goeth down west to Fleet Dyke, from whence men must turn again the same way they came, but there it stopped.&quot; There used to be a proverb, &quot;He must take him a house in Turnagain Lane.&quot;\n\nA conduit formerly stood on Snow Hill, a little below the church. It is described as a building with four equal sides, ornamented with four columns and pediment, surmounted by a pyramid, on which stood a lamb\u2014a rebus on the name of Lamb, from whose conduit in Red Lion Street the water came. There had been a conduit there, however, before Lamb's day, which was towards the close of the sixteenth century.\n\nAt No. 37, King Street, Snow Hill, there used to be a ladies' charity school, which was established in 1702, and remained in the parish 145 years. Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale were subscribers to this school, and Johnson drew from it his story of Betty Broom, in &quot;The Idler.&quot; The world of domestic service, in Betty's days, seems to have been pretty much as now. Betty was a poor girl, bred in the country at a charity-school, maintained by the contributions of wealthy neighbours. The patronesses visited the school from time to time, to see how the pupils got on, and everything went well, till &quot;at last, the chief of the subscribers having passed a winter in London, came down full of an opinion new and strange to the whole country. She held it little less than criminal to teach poor girls to read and write. They who are born to poverty, she said, are born to ignorance, and will work the harder the less they know. She told her friends that London was in confusion by the insolence of servants; that scarcely a girl could be got for all-work, since education had made such numbers of fine ladies, that nobody would now accept a lower title than that of a waiting-maid, or something that might qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles, and to sit at work in the parlour window. But she was resolved, for her part, to spoil no more girls. Those who were to live by their hands should neither read nor write out of her pocket. The world was bad enough already, and she would have no part in making it worse.\n\n&quot;She was for a long time warmly opposed; but she persevered in her notions, and withdrew her subscription. Few listen, without a desire of conviction, to those who advise them to spare their money. Her example and her arguments gained ground daily; and in less than a year the whole parish was convinced that the nation would be ruined if the children of the poor were taught to read and write.&quot; So the school was dissolved, and Betty with the rest was turned adrift into the wide and cold world; and her adventures there any one may read in &quot;The Idler&quot; for himself.\n\nThere is an entry in the school minutes of 1763, to the effect that the ladies of the committee censured the schoolmistress for listening to the story of the Cock Lane ghost, and &quot;desired her to keep her belief in the article to herself.&quot;\n\nSkinner Street\u2014now one of the names of the past\u2014which ran by the south side of St. Sepulchre's, and formed the connecting link between Newgate Street and Holborn, received its name from Alderman Skinner, through whose exertions, about 1802, it was principally built. The following account of Skinner Street is from the picturesque pen of Mr. William Harvey (&quot;Aleph&quot;), whose long familiarity with the places he describes renders doubly valuable his many contributions to the history of London scenes and people:\u2014&quot;As a building speculation,&quot; he says, writing in 1863, &quot;it was a failure. When the buildings were ready for occupation, tall and substantial as they really were, the high rents frightened intending shopkeepers. Tenants were not to be had; and in order to get over the money difficulty, a lottery, sanctioned by Parliament, was commenced. Lotteries were then common tricks of finance, and nobody wondered at the new venture; but even the most desperate fortune-hunters were slow to invest their capital, and the tickets hung sadly on hand. The day for the drawing was postponed several times, and when it came, there was little or no excitement on the subject, and whoever rejoiced in becoming a house-owner on such easy terms, the original projectors and builders were understood to have suffered considerably. The winners found the property in a very unfinished condition. Few of the dwellings were habitable, and as funds were often wanting, a majority of the houses remained empty, and the shops unopened. After two or three years things began to improve; the vast many-storeyed house which then covered the site of Commercial Place was converted into a warehousing dep\u00f4t; a capital house opposite the 'Saracen's Head' was taken by a hosier of the name of Theobald, who, opening his shop with the determination of selling the best hosiery, and nothing else, was able to convince the citizens that his hose was first-rate, and, desiring only a living profit, succeeded, after thirty years of unwearied industry, in accumulating a large fortune. Theobald was possessed of literary tastes, and at the sale of Sir Walter Scott's manuscripts was a liberal purchaser. He also collected a library of exceedingly choice books, and when aristocratic customers purchased stockings of him, was soon able to interest them in matters of far higher interest\u2026\n\n&quot;The most remarkable shop\u2014but it was on the left-hand side, at a corner house\u2014was that established for the sale of children's books. It boasted an immense extent of window-front, extending from the entrance into Snow Hill, and towards Fleet Market. Many a time have I lingered with loving eyes over those fascinating story-books, so rich in gaily-coloured prints; such careful editions of the marvellous old histories, 'Puss in Boots,' 'Cock Robin,' 'Cinderella,' and the like. Fortunately the front was kept low, so as exactly to suit the capacity of a childish admirer. . . . . But Skinner Street did not prosper much, and never could compete with even the dullest portions of Holborn. I have spoken of some reputable shops; but you know the proverb, 'One swallow will not make a summer,' and it was a declining neighbourhood almost before it could be called new. In 1810 the commercial dep\u00f4t, which had been erected at a cost of \u00a325,000, and was the chief prize in the lottery, was destroyed by fire, never to be rebuilt\u2014a heavy blow and discouragement to Skinner Street, from which it never rallied. Perhaps the periodical hanging-days exercised an unfavourable influence, collecting, as they frequently did, all the thieves and vagabonds of London. I never sympathised with Pepys or Charles Fox in their passion for public executions, and made it a point to avoid those ghastly sights; but early of a Monday morning, when I had just reached the end of Giltspur Street, a miserable wretch had just been turned off from the platform of the debtors' door, and I was made the unwilling witness of his last struggles. That scene haunted me for months, and I often used to ask myself, 'Who that could help it would live in Skinner Street?' The next unpropitious event in these parts was the unexpected closing of the child's library. What could it mean? Such a well-to-do establishment shut up? Yes, the whole army of shutters looked blankly on the inquirer, and forbade even a single glance at 'Sinbad' or 'Robinson Crusoe.' It would soon be re-opened, we naturally thought; but the shutters never came down again. The whole house was deserted; not even a messenger in bankruptcy, or an ancient Charley, was found to regard the playful double knocks of the neighbouring juveniles. Gradually the glass of all the windows got broken in, a heavy cloud of black dust, solidifying into inches thick, gathered on sills and doors and brickwork, till the whole frontage grew as gloomy as Giant Despair's Castle. Not long after, the adjoining houses shared the same fate, and they remained from year to year without the slightest sign of life\u2014absolute scarecrows, darkening with their uncomfortable shadows the busy streets. Within half a mile, in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, there are (1863) seven houses in a similar predicament\u2014 window-glass demolished, doors cracked from top to bottom, spiders' webs hanging from every projecting sill or parapet. What can it mean? The loss in the article of rents alone must be over \u00a31,000 annually. If the real owners are at feud with imaginary owners, surely the property might be rendered valuable, and the proceeds invested. Even the lawyers can derive no profit from such hopeless abandonment. I am told the whole mischief arose out of a Chancery suit. Can it be the famous 'Jarndyce v. Jarndyce' case? And have all the heirs starved each other out? If so, what hinders our lady the Queen from taking possession? Any change would be an improvement, for these dead houses make the streets they cumber as dispiriting and comfortless as graveyards. Busy fancy will sometimes people them, and fill the dreary rooms with strange guests. Do the victims of guilt congregate in these dark dens? Do wretches 'unfriended by the world or the world's law,' seek refuge in these deserted nooks, mourning in the silence of despair over their former lives, and anticipating the future in unappeasable agony? Such things have been\u2014the silence and desolation of these doomed dwellings make them the more suitable for such tenants.&quot;\n\nA street is nothing without a mystery, so a mystery let these old tumble-down houses remain, whilst we go on to tell that, in front of No. 58, the sailor Cashman was hung in 1817, as we have already mentioned, for plundering a gunsmith's shop there. William Godwin, the author of &quot;Caleb Williams,&quot; kept a bookseller's shop for several years in Skinner Street, at No. 41, and published school-books in the name of Edward Baldwin. On the wall there was a stone carving of \u00c6sop reciting one of his fables to children.\n\nThe most noteworthy event of the life of Godwin was his marriage with the celebrated Mary Wollstonecraft, authoress of a &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women,&quot; whose congenial mind, in politics and morals, he ardently admired. Godwin's account of the way in which they got on together is worth reading:\u2014&quot;Ours,&quot; he writes, &quot;was not an idle happiness, a paradise of selfish and transitory pleasures. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to mention, that influenced by ideas I had long entertained, I engaged an apartment about twenty doors from our house, in the Polygon, Somers Town, which I designed for the purpose of my study and literary occupations. Trifles, however, will be interesting to some readers, when they relate to the last period of the life of such a person as Mary. I will add, therefore, that we were both of us of opinion, that it was possible for two persons to be too uniformly in each other's society. Influenced by that opinion, it was my practice to repair to the apartment I have mentioned as soon as I rose, and frequently not to make my appearance in the Polygon till the hour of dinner. We agreed in condemning the notion, prevalent in many situations in life, that a man and his wife cannot visit in mixed society but in company with each other, and we rather sought occasions of deviating from than of complying with this rule. By this means, though, for the most part, we spent the latter half of each day in one another's society, yet we were in no danger of satiety. We seemed to combine, in a considerable degree, the novelty and lively sensation of a visit with the more delicious and heartfelt pleasure of a domestic life.&quot;\n\nThis philosophic union, to Godwin's inexpressible affliction, did not last more than eighteen months, at the end of which time Mrs. Godwin died, leaving an only daughter, who in the course of time became the second wife of the poet Shelley, and was the author of the wild and extraordinary tale of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116<\/a>"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Jelltex","count_faves":"13","count_comments":"0","can_comment":0,"permissions":{"permcomment":1},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":67,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":160,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":213,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":333,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":427,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":533,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5602\/15596141429_c03f873b95_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":683,"pathalias":"jelltecks"},{"id":"15600865627","owner":"16105638@N00","secret":"0d23723423","server":"5608","farm":6,"title":"St Sepulchre Without Newgate, City of London","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"With the rain falling harder, it was a bit of a route march to Holborn and my next church, the stunning St Sepulchre, which was also open.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSt Sepulchre-without-Newgate, also known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Holborn), is an Anglican church in the City of London. It is located on Holborn Viaduct, almost opposite the Old Bailey. In medieval times it stood just outside (&quot;without&quot;) the now-demolished old city wall, near the Newgate. It has been a living of St John's College, Oxford, since 1622.\n\nThe original Saxon church on the site was dedicated to St Edmund the King and Martyr. During the Crusades in the 12th century the church was renamed St Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, in reference to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The name eventually became contracted to St Sepulchre.\n\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the City. It was completely rebuilt in the 15th century but was gutted by the Great Fire of London in 1666,[1] which left only the outer walls, the tower and the porch standing[2] -. Modified in the 18th century, the church underwent extensive restoration in 1878. It narrowly avoided destruction in the Second World War, although the 18th-century watch-house in its churchyard (erected to deter grave-robbers) was completely destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a coffered ceiling[3] installed in 1834. The Vicars' old residence has recently been renovated into a modern living quarter.\n\nDuring the reign of Mary I in 1555, St Sepulchre's vicar, John Rogers, was burned as a heretic.\n\nSt Sepulchre is named in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons as the &quot;bells of Old Bailey&quot;. Traditionally, the great bell would be rung to mark the execution of a prisoner at the nearby gallows at Newgate. The clerk of St Sepulchre's was also responsible for ringing a handbell outside the condemned man's cell in Newgate Prison to inform him of his impending execution. This handbell, known as the Execution Bell, now resides in a glass case to the south of the nave.\n\nThe church has been the official musicians' church for many years and is associated with many famous musicians. Its north aisle (formerly a chapel dedicated to Stephen Harding) is dedicated as the Musicians' Chapel, with four windows commemorating John Ireland, the singer Dame Nellie Melba, Walter Carroll and the conductor Sir Henry Wood respectively.[4] Wood, who &quot;at the age of fourteen, learned to play the organ&quot; at this church [1] and later became its organist, also has his ashes buried in this church.\n\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.[5] The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the City of London Rifles (the 6th Battalion London Regiment). The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate<\/a>\n\nThe Early History of St. Sepulchre's\u2014Its Destruction in 1666\u2014The Exterior and Interior\u2014The Early Popularity of the Church\u2014Interments here\u2014Roger Ascham, the Author of the &quot;Schoolmaster&quot;\u2014Captain John Smith, and his Romantic Adventures\u2014Saved by an Indian Girl\u2014 St. Sepulchre's Churchyard\u2014Accommodation for a Murderess\u2014The Martyr Rogers\u2014An Odd Circumstance\u2014Good Company for the Dead\u2014A Leap from the Tower\u2014A Warning Bell and a Last Admonition\u2014Nosegays for the Condemned\u2014The Route to the Gallows-tree\u2014 The Deeds of the Charitable\u2014The &quot;Saracen's Head&quot;\u2014Description by Dickens\u2014Giltspur Street\u2014Giltspur Street Compter\u2014A Disreputable Condition\u2014Pie Corner\u2014Hosier Lane\u2014A Spurious Relic\u2014The Conduit on Snow Hill\u2014A Ladies' Charity School\u2014Turnagain Lane\u2014Poor Betty!\u2014A Schoolmistress Censured\u2014Skinner Street\u2014Unpropitious Fortune\u2014William Godwin\u2014An Original Married Life.\n\nMany interesting associations\u2014Principally, however, connected with the annals of crime and the execution of the laws of England\u2014belong to the Church of St. Sepulchre, or St. 'Pulchre. This sacred edifice\u2014anciently known as St. Sepulchre's in the Bailey, or by Chamberlain Gate (now Newgate)\u2014stands at the eastern end of the slight acclivity of Snow Hill, and between Smithfield and the Old Bailey. The genuine materials for its early history are scanty enough. It was probably founded about the commencement of the twelfth century, but of the exact date and circumstances of its origin there is no record whatever. Its name is derived from the Holy Sepulchre of our Saviour at Jerusalem, to the memory of which it was first dedicated.\n\nThe earliest authentic notice of the church, according to Maitland, is of the year 1178, at which date it was given by Roger, Bishop of Sarum, to the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew. These held the right of advowson until the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., and from that time until 1610 it remained in the hands of the Crown. James I., however, then granted &quot;the rectory and its appurtenances, with the advowson of the vicarage,&quot; to Francis Phillips and others. The next stage in its history is that the rectory was purchased by the parishioners, to be held in fee-farm of the Crown, and the advowson was obtained by the President and Fellows of St. John the Baptist College, at Oxford.\n\nThe church was rebuilt about the middle of the fifteenth century, when one of the Popham family, who had been Chancellor of Normandy and Treasurer of the King's Household, with distinguished liberality erected a handsome chapel on the south side of the choir, and the very beautiful porch still remaining at the south-west corner of the building. &quot;His image,&quot; Stow says, &quot;fair graven in stone, was fixed over the said porch.&quot;\n\nThe dreadful fire of 1666 almost destroyed St. Sepulchre's, but the parishioners set energetically to work, and it was &quot;rebuilt and beautified both within and without.&quot; The general reparation was under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, and nothing but the walls of the old building, and these not entirely, were suffered to remain. The work was done rapidly, and the whole was completed within four years.\n\n&quot;The tower,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;retained its original aspect, and the body of the church, after its restoration, presented a series of windows between buttresses, with pointed heads filled with tracery, crowned by a string-course and battlements. In this form it remained till the year 1790, when it appears the whole fabric was found to be in a state of great decay, and it was resolved to repair it throughout. Accordingly the walls of the church were cased with Portland stone, and all the windows were taken out and replaced by others with plain semi-circular heads, as now seen\u2014certainly agreeing but badly with the tower and porch of the building, but according with the then prevailing spirit of economy. The battlements, too, were taken down, and a plain stone parapet was substituted, so that at this time (with the exception of the roof, which was wagon-headed, and presented on the outside an unsightly swell, visible above the parapet) the church assumed its present appearance.&quot; The ungainly roof was removed, and an entirely new one erected, about 1836.\n\nAt each corner of the tower\u2014&quot;one of the most ancient,&quot; says the author of &quot;Londinium Redivivum,&quot; &quot;in the outline of the circuit of London&quot; \u2014there are spires, and on the spires there are weathercocks. These have been made use of by Howell to point a moral: &quot;Unreasonable people,&quot; says he, &quot;are as hard to reconcile as the vanes of St. Sepulchre's tower, which never look all four upon one point of the heavens.&quot; Nothing can be said with certainty as to the date of the tower, but it is not without the bounds of probability that it formed part of the original building. The belfry is reached by a small winding staircase in the south-west angle, and a similar staircase in an opposite angle leads to the summit. The spires at the corners, and some of the tower windows, have very recently undergone several alterations, which have added much to the picturesqueness and beauty of the church.\n\nThe chief entrance to St. Sepulchre's is by a porch of singular beauty, projecting from the south side of the tower, at the western end of the church. The groining of the ceiling of this porch, it has been pointed out, takes an almost unique form; the ribs are carved in bold relief, and the bosses at the intersections represent angels' heads, shields, roses, &amp;c., in great variety.\n\nComing now to the interior of the church, we find it divided into three aisles, by two ranges of Tuscan columns. The aisles are of unequal widths, that in the centre being the widest, that to the south the narrowest. Semi-circular arches connect the columns on either side, springing directly from their capitals, without the interposition of an entablature, and support a large dental cornice, extending round the church. The ceiling of the middle aisle is divided into seven compartments, by horizontal bands, the middle compartment being formed into a small dome.\n\nThe aisles have groined ceilings, ornamented at the angles with doves, &amp;c., and beneath every division of the groining are small windows, to admit light to the galleries. Over each of the aisles there is a gallery, very clumsily introduced, which dates from the time when the church was built by Wren, and extends the whole length, excepting at the chancel. The front of the gallery, which is of oak, is described by Mr. Godwin as carved into scrolls, branches, &amp;c., in the centre panel, on either side, with the initials &quot;C. R.,&quot; enriched with carvings of laurel, which have, however, he says, &quot;but little merit.&quot;\n\nAt the east end of the church there are three semicircular-headed windows. Beneath the centre one is a large Corinthian altar-piece of oak, displaying columns, entablatures, &amp;c., elaborately carved and gilded.\n\nThe length of the church, exclusive of the ambulatory, is said to be 126 feet, the breadth 68 feet, and the height of the tower 140 feet.\n\nA singularly ugly sounding-board, extending over the preacher, used to stand at the back of the pulpit, at the east end of the church. It was in the shape of a large parabolic reflector, about twelve feet in diameter, and was composed of ribs of mahogany.\n\nAt the west end of the church there is a large organ, said to be the oldest and one of the finest in London. It was built in 1677, and has been greatly enlarged. Its reed-stops (hautboy, clarinet, &amp;c.) are supposed to be unrivalled. In Newcourt's time the church was taken notice of as &quot;remarkable for possessing an exceedingly fine organ, and the playing is thought so beautiful, that large congregations are attracted, though some of the parishioners object to the mode of performing divine service.&quot;\n\nOn the north side of the church, Mr. Godwin mentions, is a large apartment known as &quot;St. Stephen's Chapel.&quot; This building evidently formed a somewhat important part of the old church, and was probably appropriated to the votaries of the saint whose name it bears.\n\nBetween the exterior and the interior of the church there is little harmony. &quot;For example,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;the columns which form the south aisle face, in some instances, the centre of the large windows which occur in the external wall of the church, and in others the centre of the piers, indifferently.&quot; This discordance may likely enough have arisen from the fact that when the church was rebuilt, or rather restored, after the Great Fire, the works were done without much attention from Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nSt. Sepulchre's appears to have enjoyed considerable popularity from the earliest period of its history, if one is to judge from the various sums left by well-disposed persons for the support of certain fraternities founded in the church\u2014namely, those of St. Katherine, St. Michael, St. Anne, and Our Lady\u2014and by others, for the maintenance of chantry priests to celebrate masses at stated intervals for the good of their souls. One of the fraternities just named\u2014that of St. Katherine\u2014 originated, according to Stow, in the devotion of some poor persons in the parish, and was in honour of the conception of the Virgin Mary. They met in the church on the day of the Conception, and there had the mass of the day, and offered to the same, and provided a certain chaplain daily to celebrate divine service, and to set up wax lights before the image belonging to the fraternity, on all festival days.\n\nThe most famous of all who have been interred in St. Sepulchre's is Roger Ascham, the author of the &quot;Schoolmaster,&quot; and the instructor of Queen Elizabeth in Greek and Latin. This learned old worthy was born in 1515, near Northallerton, in Yorkshire. He was educated at Cambridge University, and in time rose to be the university orator, being notably zealous in promoting what was then a novelty in England\u2014the study of the Greek language. To divert himself after the fatigue of severe study, he used to devote himself to archery. This drew down upon him the censure of the all-work-and-no-play school; and in defence of himself, Ascham, in 1545, published &quot;Toxophilus,&quot; a treatise on his favourite sport. This book is even yet well worthy of perusal, for its enthusiasm, and for its curious descriptions of the personal appearance and manners of the principal persons whom the author had seen and conversed with. Henry VIII. rewarded him with a pension of \u00a310 per annum, a considerable sum in those days. In 1548, Ascham, on the death of William Grindall, who had been his pupil, was appointed instructor in the learned languages to Lady Elizabeth, afterwards the good Queen Bess. At the end of two years he had some dispute with, or took a disgust at, Lady Elizabeth's attendants, resigned his situation, and returned to his college. Soon after this he was employed as secretary to the English ambassador at the court of Charles V. of Germany, and remained abroad till the death of Edward VI. During his absence he had been appointed Latin secretary to King Edward. Strangely enough, though Queen Mary and her ministers were Papists, and Ascham a Protestant, he was retained in his office of Latin secretary, his pension was increased to \u00a320, and he was allowed to retain his fellowship and his situation as university orator. In 1554 he married a lady of good family, by whom he had a considerable fortune, and of whom, in writing to a friend, he gives, as might perhaps be expected, an excellent character. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, she not only required his services as Latin secretary, but as her instructor in Greek, and he resided at Court during the remainder of his life. He died in consequence of his endeavours to complete a Latin poem which he intended to present to the queen on the New Year's Day of 1569. He breathed his last two days before 1568 ran out, and was interred, according to his own directions, in the most private manner, in St. Sepulchre's Church, his funeral sermon being preached by Dr. Andrew Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's. He was universally lamented; and even the queen herself not only showed great concern, but was pleased to say that she would rather have lost ten thousand pounds than her tutor Ascham, which, from that somewhat closehanded sovereign, was truly an expression of high regard.\n\nAscham, like most men, had his little weaknesses. He had too great a propensity to dice and cock-fighting. Bishop Nicholson would try to convince us that this is an unfounded calumny, but, as it is mentioned by Camden, and other contemporary writers, it seems impossible to deny it. He died, from all accounts, in indifferent circumstances. &quot;Whether,&quot; says Dr. Johnson, referring to this, &quot;Ascham was poor by his own fault, or the fault of others, cannot now be decided; but it is certain that many have been rich with less merit. His philological learning would have gained him honour in any country; and among us it may justly call for that reverence which all nations owe to those who first rouse them from ignorance, and kindle among them the light of literature.&quot; His most valuable work, &quot;The Schoolmaster,&quot; was published by his widow. The nature of this celebrated performance may be gathered from the title: &quot;The Schoolmaster; or a plain and perfite way of teaching children to understand, write, and speak the Latin tongue. \u2026 And commodious also for all such as have forgot the Latin tongue, and would by themselves, without a schoolmaster, in short time, and with small pains, recover a sufficient habilitie to understand, write, and speak Latin: by Roger Ascham, ann. 1570. At London, printed by John Daye, dwelling over Aldersgate,&quot; a printer, by the way, already mentioned by us a few chapters back (see page 208), as having printed several noted works of the sixteenth century.\n\nDr. Johnson remarks that the instruction recommended in &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot; is perhaps the best ever given for the study of languages.\n\nHere also lies buried Captain John Smith, a conspicuous soldier of fortune, whose romantic adventures and daring exploits have rarely been surpassed. He died on the 21st of June, 1631. This valiant captain was born at Willoughby, in the county of Lincoln, and helped by his doings to enliven the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. He had a share in the wars of Hungary in 1602, and in three single combats overcame three Turks, and cut off their heads. For this, and other equally brave deeds, Sigismund, Duke of Transylvania, gave him his picture set in gold, with a pension of three hundred ducats; and allowed him to bear three Turks' heads proper as his shield of arms. He afterwards went to America, where he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Indians. He escaped from them, however, at last, and resumed his brilliant career by hazarding his life in naval engagements with pirates and Spanish men-of-war. The most important act of his life was the share he had in civilising the natives of New England, and reducing that province to obedience to Great Britain. In connection with his tomb in St. Sepulchre's, he is mentioned by Stow, in his &quot;Survey,&quot; as &quot;some time Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New England.&quot;\n\nCertainly the most interesting events of his chequered career were his capture by the Indians, and the saving of his life by the Indian girl Pocahontas, a story of adventure that charms as often as it is told. Bancroft, the historian of the United States, relates how, during the early settlement of Virginia, Smith left the infant colony on an exploring expedition, and not only ascended the river Chickahominy, but struck into the interior. His companions disobeyed his instructions, and being surprised by the Indians, were put to death. Smith preserved his own life by calmness and self-possession. Displaying a pocket-compass, he amused the savages by an explanation of its power, and increased their admiration of his superior genius by imparting to them some vague conceptions of the form of the earth, and the nature of the planetary system. To the Indians, who retained him as their prisoner, his captivity was a more strange event than anything of which the traditions of their tribes preserved the memory. He was allowed to send a letter to the fort at Jamestown, and the savage wonder was increased, for he seemed by some magic to endow the paper with the gift of intelligence. It was evident that their captive was a being of a high order, and then the question arose, Was his nature beneficent, or was he to be dreaded as a dangerous enemy? Their minds were bewildered, and the decision of his fate was referred to the chief Powhatan, and before Powhatan Smith was brought. &quot;The fears of the feeble aborigines,&quot; says Bancroft, &quot;were about to prevail, and his immediate death, already repeatedly threatened and repeatedly delayed, would have been inevitable, but for the timely intercession of Pocahontas, a girl twelve years old, the daughter of Powhatan, whose confiding fondness Smith had easily won, and who firmly clung to his neck, as his head was bowed down to receive the stroke of the tomahawks. His fearlessness, and her entreaties, persuaded the council to spare the agreeable stranger, who could make hatchets for her father, and rattles and strings of beads for herself, the favourite child. The barbarians, whose decision had long been held in suspense by the mysterious awe which Smith had inspired, now resolved to receive him as a friend, and to make him a partner of their councils. They tempted him to join their bands, and lend assistance in an attack upon the white men at Jamestown; and when his decision of character succeeded in changing the current of their thoughts, they dismissed him with mutual promises of friendship and benevolence. Thus the captivity of Smith did itself become a benefit to the colony; for he had not only observed with care the country between the James and the Potomac, and had gained some knowledge of the language and manners of the natives, but he now established a peaceful intercourse between the English and the tribes of Powhatan.&quot;\n\nOn the monument erected to Smith in St. Sepulchre's Church, the following quaint lines were formerly inscribed:\u2014\n\n&quot;Here lies one conquered that hath conquered kings,\nSubdued large territories, and done things\nWhich to the world impossible would seem,\nBut that the truth is held in more esteem.\nShall I report his former service done,\nIn honour of his God, and Christendom?\nHow that he did divide, from pagans three,\nTheir heads and lives, types of his chivalry?\u2014\nFor which great service, in that climate done,\nBrave Sigismundus, King of Hungarion,\nDid give him, as a coat of arms, to wear\nThese conquered heads, got by his sword and spear.\nOr shall I tell of his adventures since\nDone in Virginia, that large continent?\nHow that he subdued kings unto his yoke,\nAnd made those heathens flee, as wind doth smoke;\nAnd made their land, being so large a station,\nAn habitation for our Christian nation,\nWhere God is glorified, their wants supplied;\nWhich else for necessaries, must have died.\nBut what avails his conquests, now he lies\nInterred in earth, a prey to worms and flies?\nOh! may his soul in sweet Elysium sleep,\nUntil the Keeper, that all souls doth keep,\nReturn to judgment; and that after thence\nWith angels he may have his recompense.&quot;\n\nSir Robert Peake, the engraver, also found a last resting-place here. He is known as the master of William Faithorne\u2014the famous English engraver of the seventeenth century\u2014and governor of Basing House for the king during the Civil War under Charles I. He died in 1667. Here also was interred the body of Dr. Bell, grandfather of the originator of a well-known system of education.\n\n&quot;The churchyard of St. Sepulchre's,&quot; we learn from Maitland, &quot;at one time extended so far into the street on the south side of the church, as to render the passage-way dangerously narrow. In 1760 the churchyard was, in consequence, levelled, and thrown open to the public. But this led to much inconvenience, and it was re-enclosed in 1802.&quot;\n\nSarah Malcolm, the murderess, was buried in the churchyard of St. Sepulchre's in 1733. This coldhearted and keen-eyed monster in human form has had her story told by us already. The parishioners seem, on this occasion, to have had no such scruples as had been exhibited by their predecessors a hundred and fifty years previous at the burial of Awfield, a traitor. We shall see presently that in those more remote days they were desirous of having at least respectable company for their deceased relatives and friends in the churchyard.\n\n&quot;For a long period,&quot; says Mr. Godwin (1838), &quot;the church was surrounded by low mean buildings, by which its general appearance was hidden; but these having been cleared away, and the neighbourhood made considerably more open, St. Sepulchre's now forms a somewhat pleasing object, notwithstanding that the tower and a part of the porch are so entirely dissimilar in style to the remainder of the building.&quot; And since Godwin's writing the surroundings of the church have been so improved that perhaps few buildings in the metropolis stand more prominently before the public eye.\n\nIn the glorious roll of martyrs who have suffered at the stake for their religious principles, a vicar of St. Sepulchre's, the Reverend John Rogers, occupies a conspicuous place. He was the first who was burned in the reign of the Bloody Mary. This eminent person had at one time been chaplain to the English merchants at Antwerp, and while residing in that city had aided Tindal and Coverdale in their great work of translating the Bible. He married a German lady of good position, by whom he had a large family, and was enabled, by means of her relations, to reside in peace and safety in Germany. It appeared to be his duty, however, to return to England, and there publicly profess and advocate his religious convictions, even at the risk of death. He crossed the sea; he took his place in the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross; he preached a fearless and animated sermon, reminding his astonished audience of the pure and wholesome doctrine which had been promulgated from that pulpit in the days of the good King Edward, and solemnly warning them against the pestilent idolatry and superstition of these new times. It was his last sermon. He was apprehended, tried, condemned, and burned at Smithfield. We described, when speaking of Smithfield, the manner in which he met his fate.\n\nConnected with the martyrdom of Rogers an odd circumstance is quoted in the &quot;Churches of London.&quot; It is stated that when the bishops had resolved to put to death Joan Bocher, a friend came to Rogers and earnestly entreated his influence that the poor woman's life might be spared, and other means taken to prevent the spread of her heterodox doctrines. Rogers, however, contended that she should be executed; and his friend then begged him to choose some other kind of death, which should be more agreeable to the gentleness and mercy prescribed in the gospel. &quot;No,&quot; replied Rogers, &quot;burning alive is not a cruel death, but easy enough.&quot; His friend hearing these words, expressive of so little regard for the sufferings of a fellow-creature, answered him with great vehemence, at the same time striking Rogers' hand, &quot;Well, it may perhaps so happen that you yourself shall have your hands full of this mild burning.&quot; There is no record of Rogers among the papers belonging to St. Sepulchre's, but this may easily be accounted for by the fact that at the Great Fire of 1666 nearly all the registers and archives were destroyed.\n\nA noteworthy incident in the history of St. Sepulchre's was connected with the execution, in 1585, of Awfield, for &quot;sparcinge abrood certen lewed, sedicious, and traytorous bookes.&quot; &quot;When he was executed,&quot; says Fleetwood, the Recorder, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, July 7th of that year, &quot;his body was brought unto St. Pulcher's to be buryed, but the parishioners would not suffer a traytor's corpse to be laid in the earth where their parents, wives, children, kindred, masters, and old neighbours did rest; and so his carcass was returned to the burial-ground near Tyburn, and there I leave it.&quot;\n\nAnother event in the history of the church is a tale of suicide. On the 10th of April, 1600, a man named William Dorrington threw himself from the roof of the tower, leaving there a prayer for forgiveness.\n\nWe come now to speak of the connection of St. Sepulchre's with the neighbouring prison of Newgate. Being the nearest church to the prison, that connection naturally was intimate. Its clock served to give the time to the hangman when there was an execution in the Old Bailey, and many a poor wretch's last moments must it have regulated.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the altar a board with a list of charitable donations and gifts used to contain the following item:\u2014&quot;1605. Mr. Robert Dowe gave, for ringing the greatest bell in this church on the day the condemned prisoners are executed, and for other services, for ever, concerning such condemned prisoners, for which services the sexton is paid \u00a316s. 8d.\u2014\u00a350.\n\nIt was formerly the practice for the clerk or bellman of St. Sepulchre's to go under Newgate, on the night preceding the execution of a criminal, ring his bell, and repeat the following wholesome advice:\u2014\n\n&quot;All you that in the condemned hold do lie,\nPrepare you, for to-morrow you shall die;\nWatch all, and pray, the hour is drawing near\nThat you before the Almighty must appear;\nExamine well yourselves, in time repent,\nThat you may not to eternal flames be sent.\nAnd when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,\nThe Lord above have mercy on your souls.\nPast twelve o'clock!&quot;\n\nThis practice is explained by a passage in Munday's edition of Stow, in which it is told that a Mr. John Dowe, citizen and merchant taylor of London, gave \u00a350 to the parish church of St. Sepulchre's, under the following conditions:\u2014After the several sessions of London, on the night before the execution of such as were condemned to death, the clerk of the church was to go in the night-time, and also early in the morning, to the window of the prison in which they were lying. He was there to ring &quot;certain tolls with a hand-bell&quot; appointed for the purpose, and was afterwards, in a most Christian manner, to put them in mind of their present condition and approaching end, and to exhort them to be prepared, as they ought to be, to die. When they were in the cart, and brought before the walls of the church, the clerk was to stand there ready with the same bell, and, after certain tolls, rehearse a prayer, desiring all the people there present to pray for the unfortunate criminals. The beadle, also, of Merchant Taylors' Hall was allowed an &quot;honest stipend&quot; to see that this ceremony was regularly performed.\n\nThe affecting admonition\u2014&quot;affectingly good,&quot; Pennant calls it\u2014addressed to the prisoners in Newgate, on the night before execution, ran as follows:\u2014\n\n&quot;You prisoners that are within,\nWho, for wickedness and sin,\n\nafter many mercies shown you, are now appointed to die to-morrow in the forenoon; give ear and understand that, to-morrow morning, the greatest bell of St. Sepulchre's shall toll for you, in form and manner of a passing-bell, as used to be tolled for those that are at the point of death; to the end that all godly people, hearing that bell, and knowing it is for your going to your deaths, may be stirred up heartily to pray to God to bestow his grace and mercy upon you, whilst you live. I beseech you, for Jesus Christ's sake, to keep this night in watching and prayer, to the salvation of your own souls while there is yet time and place for mercy; as knowing to-morrow you must appear before the judgment-seat of your Creator, there to give an account of all things done in this life, and to suffer eternal torments for your sins committed against Him, unless, upon your hearty and unfeigned repentance, you find mercy through the merits, death, and passion of your only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return to Him.&quot;\n\nAnd the following was the admonition to condemned criminals, as they were passing by St. Sepulchre's Church wall to execution:\u2014&quot; All good people, pray heartily unto God for these poor sinners, who are now going to their death, for whom this great bell doth toll.\n\n&quot;You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask mercy of the Lord, for the salvation of your own souls, through the [merits, death, and passion of Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto Him.\n\n&quot;Lord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.\nLord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.&quot;\n\nThe charitable Mr. Dowe, who took such interest in the last moments of the occupants of the condemned cell, was buried in the church of St. Botolph, Aldgate.\n\nAnother curious custom observed at St. Sepulchre's was the presentation of a nosegay to every criminal on his way to execution at Tyburn. No doubt the practice had its origin in some kindly feeling for the poor unfortunates who were so soon to bid farewell to all the beauties of earth. One of the last who received a nosegay from the steps of St. Sepulchre's was &quot;Sixteen-string Jack,&quot; alias John Rann, who was hanged, in 1774, for robbing the Rev. Dr. Bell of his watch and eighteen pence in money, in Gunnersbury Lane, on the road to Brentford. Sixteen-string Jack wore the flowers in his button-hole as he rode dolefully to the gallows. This was witnessed by John Thomas Smith, who thus describes the scene in his admirable anecdotebook, &quot;Nollekens and his Times:&quot;\u2014&quot; I remember well, when I was in my eighth year, Mr. Nollekens calling at my father's house, in Great Portland Street, and taking us to Oxford Street, to see the notorious Jack Rann, commonly called Sixteenstring Jack, go to Tyburn to be hanged. \u2026 The criminal was dressed in a pea-green coat, with an immense nosegay in the button-hole, which had been presented to him at St. Sepulchre's steps; and his nankeen small-clothes, we were told, were tied at each knee with sixteen strings. After he had passed, and Mr. Nollekens was leading me home by the hand, I recollect his stooping down to me and observing, in a low tone of voice, 'Tom, now, my little man, if my father-in-law, Mr. Justice Welch, had been high constable, we could have walked by the side of the cart all the way to Tyburn.'&quot;\n\nWhen criminals were conveyed from Newgate to Tyburn, the cart passed up Giltspur Street, and through Smithfield, to Cow Lane. Skinner Street had not then been built, and the Crooked Lane which turned down by St. Sepulchre's, as well as Ozier Lane, did not afford sufficient width to admit of the cavalcade passing by either of them, with convenience, to Holborn Hill, or &quot;the Heavy Hill,&quot; as it used to be called. The procession seems at no time to have had much of the solemn element about it. &quot;The heroes of the day were often,&quot; says a popular writer, &quot;on good terms with the mob, and jokes were exchanged between the men who were going to be hanged and the men who deserved to be.&quot;\n\n&quot;On St. Paul's Day,&quot; says Mr. Timbs (1868), &quot;service is performed in St. Sepulchre's, in accordance with the will of Mr. Paul Jervis, who, in 1717, devised certain land in trust that a sermon should be preached in the church upon every Paul's Day upon the excellence of the liturgy o the Church of England; the preacher to receive 40s. for such sermon. Various sums are also bequeathed to the curate, the clerk, the treasurer, and masters of the parochial schools. To the poor of the parish he bequeathed 20s. a-piece to ten of the poorest householders within that part of the parish of St. Sepulchre commonly called Smithfield quarter, \u00a34 to the treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and 6s. 8d. yearly to the clerk, who shall attend to receive the same. The residue of the yearly rents and profits is to be distributed unto and amongst such poor people of the parish of St. Sepulchre's, London, who shall attend the service and sermon. At the close of the service the vestry-clerk reads aloud an extract from the will, and then proceeds to the distribution of the money. In the evening the vicar, churchwardens, and common councilmen of the precinct dine together.&quot;\n\nIn 1749, a Mr. Drinkwater made a praiseworthy bequest. He left the parish of St. Sepulchre \u00a3500 to be lent in sums of \u00a325 to industrious young tradesmen. No interest was to be charged, and the money was to be lent for four years.\n\nNext to St. Sepulchre's, on Snow Hill, used to stand the famous old inn of the &quot;Saracen's Head.&quot; It was only swept away within the last few years by the ruthless army of City improvers: a view of it in course of demolition was given on page 439. It was one of the oldest of the London inns which bore the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; for a sign. One of Dick Tarlton's jests makes mention of the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; without Newgate, and Stow, describing this neighbourhood, speaks particularly of &quot;a fair large inn for receipt of travellers&quot; that &quot;hath to sign the 'Saracen's Head.'&quot; The courtyard had, to the last, many of the characteristics of an old English inn; there were galleries all round leading to the bedrooms, and a spacious gateway through which the dusty mail-coaches used to rumble, the tired passengers creeping forth &quot;thanking their stars in having escaped the highwaymen and the holes and sloughs of the road.&quot; Into that courtyard how many have come on their first arrival in London with hearts beating high with hope, some of whom have risen to be aldermen and sit in state as lord mayor, whilst others have gone the way of the idle apprentice and come to a sad end at Tyburn! It was at this inn that Nicholas Nickleby and his uncle waited upon the Yorkshire schoolmaster Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall. Mr. Dickens describes the tavern as it existed in the last days of mail-coaching, when it was a most important place for arrivals and departures in London:\u2014\n\n&quot;Next to the jail, and by consequence near to Smithfield also, and the Compter and the bustle and noise of the City, and just on that particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastwards seriously think of falling down on purpose, and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westwards not unfrequently fall by accident, is the coach-yard of the 'Saracen's Head' inn, its portals guarded by two Saracen's heads and shoulders, which it was once the pride and glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night, but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity, possibly because this species of humour is now confined to St. James's parish, where doorknockers are preferred as being more portable, and bell-wires esteemed as convenient tooth-picks. Whether this be the reason or not, there they are, frowning upon you from each side of the gateway; and the inn itself, garnished with another Saracen's head, frowns upon you from the top of the yard; while from the door of the hind-boot of all the red coaches that are standing therein, there glares a small Saracen's head with a twin expression to the large Saracen's head below, so that the general appearance of the pile is of the Saracenic order.&quot;\n\nTo explain the use of the Saracen's head as an inn sign various reasons have been given. &quot;When our countrymen,&quot; says Selden, &quot;came home from fighting with the Saracens and were beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible faces (as you still see the 'Saracen's Head' is), when in truth they were like other men. But this they did to save their own credit.&quot; Or the sign may have been adopted by those who had visited the Holy Land either as pilgrims or to fight the Saracens. Others, again, hold that it was first set up in compliment to the mother of Thomas \u00e0 Becket, who was the daughter of a Saracen. However this may be, it is certain that the use of the sign in former days was very general.\n\nRunning past the east end of St. Sepulchre's, from Newgate into West Smithfield, is Giltspur Street, anciently called Knightriders Street. This interesting thoroughfare derives its name from the knights with their gilt spurs having been accustomed to ride this way to the jousts and tournaments which in days of old were held in Smithfield.\n\nIn this street was Giltspur Street Compter, a debtors' prison and house of correction appertaining to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex. It stood over against St. Sepulchre's Church, and was removed hither from the east side of Wood Street, Cheapside, in 1791. At the time of its removal it was used as a place of imprisonment for debtors, but the yearly increasing demands upon the contracted space caused that department to be given up, and City debtors were sent to Whitecross Street. The architect was Dance, to whom we are also indebted for the grim pile of Newgate. The Compter was a dirty and appropriately convictlooking edifice. It was pulled down in 1855. Mr. Hepworth Dixon gave an interesting account of this City House of Correction, not long before its demolition, in his &quot;London Prisons&quot; (1850). &quot;Entering,&quot; he says, &quot;at the door facing St. Sepulchre's, the visitor suddenly finds himself in a low dark passage, leading into the offices of the gaol, and branching off into other passages, darker, closer, more replete with noxious smells, than even those of Newgate. This is the fitting prelude to what follows. The prison, it must be noticed, is divided into two principal divisions, the House of Correction and the Compter. The front in Giltspur Street, and the side nearest to Newgate Street, is called the Compter. In its wards are placed detenues of various kinds\u2014remands, committals from the police-courts, and generally persons waiting for trial, and consequently still unconvicted. The other department, the House of Correction, occupies the back portion of the premises, abutting on Christ's Hospital. Curious it is to consider how thin a wall divides these widely-separate worlds! And sorrowful it is to think what a difference of destiny awaits the children\u2014destiny inexorable, though often unearned in either case\u2014who, on the one side of it or the other, receive an eleemosynary education! The collegian and the criminal! Who shall say how much mere accident\u2014 circumstances over which the child has little power \u2014determines to a life of usefulness or mischief? From the yards of Giltspur Street prison almost the only objects visible, outside of the gaol itself, are the towers of Christ's Hospital; the only sounds audible, the shouts of the scholars at their play. The balls of the hospital boys often fall within the yards of the prison. Whether these sights and sounds ever cause the criminal to pause and reflect upon the courses of his life, we will not say, but the stranger visiting the place will be very apt to think for him. \u2026\n\n&quot;In the department of the prison called the House of Correction, minor offenders within the City of London are imprisoned. No transports are sent hither, nor is any person whose sentence is above three years in length.&quot; This able writer then goes on to tell of the many crying evils connected with the institution\u2014the want of air, the over-crowded state of the rooms, the absence of proper cellular accommodation, and the vicious intercourse carried on amongst the prisoners. The entire gaol, when he wrote, only contained thirty-six separate sleeping-rooms. Now by the highest prison calculation\u2014and this, be it noted, proceeds on the assumption that three persons can sleep in small, miserable, unventilated cells, which are built for only one, and are too confined for that, being only about one-half the size of the model cell for one at Pentonville\u2014it was only capable of accommodating 203 prisoners, yet by the returns issued at Michaelmas, 1850, it contained 246!\n\nA large section of the prison used to be devoted to female delinquents, but lately it was almost entirely given up to male offenders.\n\n&quot;The House of Correction, and the Compter portion of the establishment,&quot; says Mr. Dixon, &quot;are kept quite distinct, but it would be difficult to award the palm of empire in their respective facilities for demoralisation. We think the Compter rather the worse of the two. You are shown into a room, about the size of an apartment in an ordinary dwelling-house, which will be found crowded with from thirty to forty persons, young and old, and in their ordinary costume; the low thief in his filth and rags, and the member of the swell-mob with his bright buttons, flash finery, and false jewels. Here you notice the boy who has just been guilty of his first offence, and committed for trial, learning with a greedy mind a thousand criminal arts, and listening with the precocious instinct of guilty passions to stories and conversations the most depraved and disgusting. You regard him with a mixture of pity and loathing, for he knows that the eyes of his peers are upon him, and he stares at you with a familiar impudence, and exhibits a devil-may-care countenance, such as is only to be met with in the juvenile offender. Here, too, may be seen the young clerk, taken up on suspicion\u2014perhaps innocent\u2014who avoids you with a shy look of pain and uneasiness: what a hell must this prison be to him! How frightful it is to think of a person really untainted with crime, compelled to herd for ten or twenty days with these abandoned wretches!\n\n&quot;On the other, the House of Correction side of the gaol, similar rooms will be found, full of prisoners communicating with each other, laughing and shouting without hindrance. All this is so little in accordance with existing notions of prison discipline, that one is continually fancying these disgraceful scenes cannot be in the capital of England, and in the year of grace 1850. Very few of the prisoners attend school or receive any instruction; neither is any kind of employment afforded them, except oakum-picking, and the still more disgusting labour of the treadmill. When at work, an officer is in attendance to prevent disorderly conduct; but his presence is of no avail as a protection to the less depraved. Conversation still goes on; and every facility is afforded for making acquaintances, and for mutual contamination.&quot;\n\nAfter having long been branded by intelligent inspectors as a disgrace to the metropolis, Giltspur Street Compter was condemned, closed in 1854, and subsequently taken down.\n\nNearly opposite what used to be the site of the Compter, and adjoining Cock Lane, is the spot called Pie Corner, near which terminated the Great Fire of 1666. The fire commenced at Pudding Lane, it will be remembered, so it was singularly appropriate that it should terminate at Pie Corner. Under the date of 4th September, 1666, Pepys, in his &quot;Diary,&quot; records that &quot;W. Hewer this day went to see how his mother did, and comes home late, telling us how he hath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in Pye Corner being burned; so that the fire is got so far that way.&quot; The figure of a fat naked boy stands over a public house at the corner of the lane; it used to have the following warning inscription attached:\u2014 &quot;This boy is in memory put up of the late fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony, 1666.&quot; According to Stow, Pie Corner derived its name from the sign of a well-frequented hostelry, which anciently stood on the spot. Strype makes honourable mention of Pie Corner, as &quot;noted chiefly for cooks' shops and pigs dressed there during Bartholomew Fair.&quot; Our old writers have many references\u2014and not all, by the way, in the best taste\u2014to its cookstalls and dressed pork. Shadwell, for instance, in the Woman Captain (1680) speaks of &quot;meat dressed at Pie Corner by greasy scullions;&quot; and Ben Jonson writes in the Alchemist (1612)\u2014\n\n&quot;I shall put you in mind, sir, at Pie Corner,\nTaking your meal of steam in from cooks' stalls.&quot;\n\nAnd in &quot;The Great Boobee&quot; (&quot;Roxburgh Ballads&quot;):\n\n&quot;Next day I through Pie Corner passed;\nThe roast meat on the stall\nInvited me to take a taste;\nMy money was but small.&quot;\n\nBut Pie Corner seems to have been noted for more than eatables. A ballad from Tom D'Urfey's &quot;Pills to Purge Melancholy,&quot; describing Bartholomew Fair, eleven years before the Fire of London, says:\u2014\n\n&quot;At Pie-Corner end, mark well my good friend,\n'Tis a very fine dirty place;\nWhere there's more arrows and bows. \u2026\nThan was handled at Chivy Chase.&quot;\n\nWe have already given a view of Pie Corner in our chapter on Smithfield, page 361.\n\nHosier Lane, running from Cow Lane to Smithfield, and almost parallel to Cock Lane, is described by &quot;R. B.,&quot; in Strype, as a place not over-well built or inhabited. The houses were all old timber erections. Some of these\u2014those standing at the south corner of the lane\u2014were in the beginning of this century depicted by Mr. J. T. Smith, in his &quot;Ancient Topography of London.&quot; He describes them as probably of the reign of James I. The rooms were small, with low, unornamented ceilings; the timber, oak, profusely used; the gables were plain, and the walls lath and plaster. They were taken down in 1809.\n\nIn the corner house, in Mr. Smith's time, there was a barber whose name was Catchpole; at least, so it was written over the door. He was rather an odd fellow, and possessed, according to his own account, a famous relic of antiquity. He would gravely show his customers a short-bladed instrument, as the identical dagger with which Walworth killed Wat Tyler.\n\nHosier Lane, like Pie Corner, used to be a great resort during the time of Bartholomew Fair, &quot;all the houses,&quot; it is said in Strype, &quot;generally being made public for tippling.&quot;\n\nWe return now from our excursion to the north of St. Sepulchre's, and continue our rambles to the west, and before speaking of what is, let us refer to what has been.\n\nTurnagain Lane is not far from this. &quot;Near unto this Seacoal Lane,&quot; remarks Stow, &quot;in the turning towards Holborn Conduit, is Turnagain Lane, or rather, as in a record of the 5th of Edward III., Windagain Lane, for that it goeth down west to Fleet Dyke, from whence men must turn again the same way they came, but there it stopped.&quot; There used to be a proverb, &quot;He must take him a house in Turnagain Lane.&quot;\n\nA conduit formerly stood on Snow Hill, a little below the church. It is described as a building with four equal sides, ornamented with four columns and pediment, surmounted by a pyramid, on which stood a lamb\u2014a rebus on the name of Lamb, from whose conduit in Red Lion Street the water came. There had been a conduit there, however, before Lamb's day, which was towards the close of the sixteenth century.\n\nAt No. 37, King Street, Snow Hill, there used to be a ladies' charity school, which was established in 1702, and remained in the parish 145 years. Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale were subscribers to this school, and Johnson drew from it his story of Betty Broom, in &quot;The Idler.&quot; The world of domestic service, in Betty's days, seems to have been pretty much as now. Betty was a poor girl, bred in the country at a charity-school, maintained by the contributions of wealthy neighbours. The patronesses visited the school from time to time, to see how the pupils got on, and everything went well, till &quot;at last, the chief of the subscribers having passed a winter in London, came down full of an opinion new and strange to the whole country. She held it little less than criminal to teach poor girls to read and write. They who are born to poverty, she said, are born to ignorance, and will work the harder the less they know. She told her friends that London was in confusion by the insolence of servants; that scarcely a girl could be got for all-work, since education had made such numbers of fine ladies, that nobody would now accept a lower title than that of a waiting-maid, or something that might qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles, and to sit at work in the parlour window. But she was resolved, for her part, to spoil no more girls. Those who were to live by their hands should neither read nor write out of her pocket. The world was bad enough already, and she would have no part in making it worse.\n\n&quot;She was for a long time warmly opposed; but she persevered in her notions, and withdrew her subscription. Few listen, without a desire of conviction, to those who advise them to spare their money. Her example and her arguments gained ground daily; and in less than a year the whole parish was convinced that the nation would be ruined if the children of the poor were taught to read and write.&quot; So the school was dissolved, and Betty with the rest was turned adrift into the wide and cold world; and her adventures there any one may read in &quot;The Idler&quot; for himself.\n\nThere is an entry in the school minutes of 1763, to the effect that the ladies of the committee censured the schoolmistress for listening to the story of the Cock Lane ghost, and &quot;desired her to keep her belief in the article to herself.&quot;\n\nSkinner Street\u2014now one of the names of the past\u2014which ran by the south side of St. Sepulchre's, and formed the connecting link between Newgate Street and Holborn, received its name from Alderman Skinner, through whose exertions, about 1802, it was principally built. The following account of Skinner Street is from the picturesque pen of Mr. William Harvey (&quot;Aleph&quot;), whose long familiarity with the places he describes renders doubly valuable his many contributions to the history of London scenes and people:\u2014&quot;As a building speculation,&quot; he says, writing in 1863, &quot;it was a failure. When the buildings were ready for occupation, tall and substantial as they really were, the high rents frightened intending shopkeepers. Tenants were not to be had; and in order to get over the money difficulty, a lottery, sanctioned by Parliament, was commenced. Lotteries were then common tricks of finance, and nobody wondered at the new venture; but even the most desperate fortune-hunters were slow to invest their capital, and the tickets hung sadly on hand. The day for the drawing was postponed several times, and when it came, there was little or no excitement on the subject, and whoever rejoiced in becoming a house-owner on such easy terms, the original projectors and builders were understood to have suffered considerably. The winners found the property in a very unfinished condition. Few of the dwellings were habitable, and as funds were often wanting, a majority of the houses remained empty, and the shops unopened. After two or three years things began to improve; the vast many-storeyed house which then covered the site of Commercial Place was converted into a warehousing dep\u00f4t; a capital house opposite the 'Saracen's Head' was taken by a hosier of the name of Theobald, who, opening his shop with the determination of selling the best hosiery, and nothing else, was able to convince the citizens that his hose was first-rate, and, desiring only a living profit, succeeded, after thirty years of unwearied industry, in accumulating a large fortune. Theobald was possessed of literary tastes, and at the sale of Sir Walter Scott's manuscripts was a liberal purchaser. He also collected a library of exceedingly choice books, and when aristocratic customers purchased stockings of him, was soon able to interest them in matters of far higher interest\u2026\n\n&quot;The most remarkable shop\u2014but it was on the left-hand side, at a corner house\u2014was that established for the sale of children's books. It boasted an immense extent of window-front, extending from the entrance into Snow Hill, and towards Fleet Market. Many a time have I lingered with loving eyes over those fascinating story-books, so rich in gaily-coloured prints; such careful editions of the marvellous old histories, 'Puss in Boots,' 'Cock Robin,' 'Cinderella,' and the like. Fortunately the front was kept low, so as exactly to suit the capacity of a childish admirer. . . . . But Skinner Street did not prosper much, and never could compete with even the dullest portions of Holborn. I have spoken of some reputable shops; but you know the proverb, 'One swallow will not make a summer,' and it was a declining neighbourhood almost before it could be called new. In 1810 the commercial dep\u00f4t, which had been erected at a cost of \u00a325,000, and was the chief prize in the lottery, was destroyed by fire, never to be rebuilt\u2014a heavy blow and discouragement to Skinner Street, from which it never rallied. Perhaps the periodical hanging-days exercised an unfavourable influence, collecting, as they frequently did, all the thieves and vagabonds of London. I never sympathised with Pepys or Charles Fox in their passion for public executions, and made it a point to avoid those ghastly sights; but early of a Monday morning, when I had just reached the end of Giltspur Street, a miserable wretch had just been turned off from the platform of the debtors' door, and I was made the unwilling witness of his last struggles. That scene haunted me for months, and I often used to ask myself, 'Who that could help it would live in Skinner Street?' The next unpropitious event in these parts was the unexpected closing of the child's library. What could it mean? Such a well-to-do establishment shut up? Yes, the whole army of shutters looked blankly on the inquirer, and forbade even a single glance at 'Sinbad' or 'Robinson Crusoe.' It would soon be re-opened, we naturally thought; but the shutters never came down again. The whole house was deserted; not even a messenger in bankruptcy, or an ancient Charley, was found to regard the playful double knocks of the neighbouring juveniles. Gradually the glass of all the windows got broken in, a heavy cloud of black dust, solidifying into inches thick, gathered on sills and doors and brickwork, till the whole frontage grew as gloomy as Giant Despair's Castle. Not long after, the adjoining houses shared the same fate, and they remained from year to year without the slightest sign of life\u2014absolute scarecrows, darkening with their uncomfortable shadows the busy streets. Within half a mile, in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, there are (1863) seven houses in a similar predicament\u2014 window-glass demolished, doors cracked from top to bottom, spiders' webs hanging from every projecting sill or parapet. What can it mean? The loss in the article of rents alone must be over \u00a31,000 annually. If the real owners are at feud with imaginary owners, surely the property might be rendered valuable, and the proceeds invested. Even the lawyers can derive no profit from such hopeless abandonment. I am told the whole mischief arose out of a Chancery suit. Can it be the famous 'Jarndyce v. Jarndyce' case? And have all the heirs starved each other out? If so, what hinders our lady the Queen from taking possession? Any change would be an improvement, for these dead houses make the streets they cumber as dispiriting and comfortless as graveyards. Busy fancy will sometimes people them, and fill the dreary rooms with strange guests. Do the victims of guilt congregate in these dark dens? Do wretches 'unfriended by the world or the world's law,' seek refuge in these deserted nooks, mourning in the silence of despair over their former lives, and anticipating the future in unappeasable agony? Such things have been\u2014the silence and desolation of these doomed dwellings make them the more suitable for such tenants.&quot;\n\nA street is nothing without a mystery, so a mystery let these old tumble-down houses remain, whilst we go on to tell that, in front of No. 58, the sailor Cashman was hung in 1817, as we have already mentioned, for plundering a gunsmith's shop there. William Godwin, the author of &quot;Caleb Williams,&quot; kept a bookseller's shop for several years in Skinner Street, at No. 41, and published school-books in the name of Edward Baldwin. On the wall there was a stone carving of \u00c6sop reciting one of his fables to children.\n\nThe most noteworthy event of the life of Godwin was his marriage with the celebrated Mary Wollstonecraft, authoress of a &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women,&quot; whose congenial mind, in politics and morals, he ardently admired. Godwin's account of the way in which they got on together is worth reading:\u2014&quot;Ours,&quot; he writes, &quot;was not an idle happiness, a paradise of selfish and transitory pleasures. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to mention, that influenced by ideas I had long entertained, I engaged an apartment about twenty doors from our house, in the Polygon, Somers Town, which I designed for the purpose of my study and literary occupations. Trifles, however, will be interesting to some readers, when they relate to the last period of the life of such a person as Mary. I will add, therefore, that we were both of us of opinion, that it was possible for two persons to be too uniformly in each other's society. Influenced by that opinion, it was my practice to repair to the apartment I have mentioned as soon as I rose, and frequently not to make my appearance in the Polygon till the hour of dinner. We agreed in condemning the notion, prevalent in many situations in life, that a man and his wife cannot visit in mixed society but in company with each other, and we rather sought occasions of deviating from than of complying with this rule. By this means, though, for the most part, we spent the latter half of each day in one another's society, yet we were in no danger of satiety. We seemed to combine, in a considerable degree, the novelty and lively sensation of a visit with the more delicious and heartfelt pleasure of a domestic life.&quot;\n\nThis philosophic union, to Godwin's inexpressible affliction, did not last more than eighteen months, at the end of which time Mrs. Godwin died, leaving an only daughter, who in the course of time became the second wife of the poet Shelley, and was the author of the wild and extraordinary tale of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116<\/a>"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Jelltex","count_faves":"5","count_comments":"0","can_comment":0,"permissions":{"permcomment":1},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":67,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":160,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":213,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":333,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":427,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":533,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5608\/15600865627_0d23723423_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":683,"pathalias":"jelltecks"},{"id":"15781058155","owner":"16105638@N00","secret":"1f916270c0","server":"7565","farm":8,"title":"St Sepulchre Without Newgate, City of London","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":0,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"With the rain falling harder, it was a bit of a route march to Holborn and my next church, the stunning St Sepulchre, which was also open.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSt Sepulchre-without-Newgate, also known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Holborn), is an Anglican church in the City of London. It is located on Holborn Viaduct, almost opposite the Old Bailey. In medieval times it stood just outside (&quot;without&quot;) the now-demolished old city wall, near the Newgate. It has been a living of St John's College, Oxford, since 1622.\n\nThe original Saxon church on the site was dedicated to St Edmund the King and Martyr. During the Crusades in the 12th century the church was renamed St Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, in reference to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The name eventually became contracted to St Sepulchre.\n\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the City. It was completely rebuilt in the 15th century but was gutted by the Great Fire of London in 1666,[1] which left only the outer walls, the tower and the porch standing[2] -. Modified in the 18th century, the church underwent extensive restoration in 1878. It narrowly avoided destruction in the Second World War, although the 18th-century watch-house in its churchyard (erected to deter grave-robbers) was completely destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a coffered ceiling[3] installed in 1834. The Vicars' old residence has recently been renovated into a modern living quarter.\n\nDuring the reign of Mary I in 1555, St Sepulchre's vicar, John Rogers, was burned as a heretic.\n\nSt Sepulchre is named in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons as the &quot;bells of Old Bailey&quot;. Traditionally, the great bell would be rung to mark the execution of a prisoner at the nearby gallows at Newgate. The clerk of St Sepulchre's was also responsible for ringing a handbell outside the condemned man's cell in Newgate Prison to inform him of his impending execution. This handbell, known as the Execution Bell, now resides in a glass case to the south of the nave.\n\nThe church has been the official musicians' church for many years and is associated with many famous musicians. Its north aisle (formerly a chapel dedicated to Stephen Harding) is dedicated as the Musicians' Chapel, with four windows commemorating John Ireland, the singer Dame Nellie Melba, Walter Carroll and the conductor Sir Henry Wood respectively.[4] Wood, who &quot;at the age of fourteen, learned to play the organ&quot; at this church [1] and later became its organist, also has his ashes buried in this church.\n\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.[5] The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the City of London Rifles (the 6th Battalion London Regiment). The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate<\/a>\n\nThe Early History of St. Sepulchre's\u2014Its Destruction in 1666\u2014The Exterior and Interior\u2014The Early Popularity of the Church\u2014Interments here\u2014Roger Ascham, the Author of the &quot;Schoolmaster&quot;\u2014Captain John Smith, and his Romantic Adventures\u2014Saved by an Indian Girl\u2014 St. Sepulchre's Churchyard\u2014Accommodation for a Murderess\u2014The Martyr Rogers\u2014An Odd Circumstance\u2014Good Company for the Dead\u2014A Leap from the Tower\u2014A Warning Bell and a Last Admonition\u2014Nosegays for the Condemned\u2014The Route to the Gallows-tree\u2014 The Deeds of the Charitable\u2014The &quot;Saracen's Head&quot;\u2014Description by Dickens\u2014Giltspur Street\u2014Giltspur Street Compter\u2014A Disreputable Condition\u2014Pie Corner\u2014Hosier Lane\u2014A Spurious Relic\u2014The Conduit on Snow Hill\u2014A Ladies' Charity School\u2014Turnagain Lane\u2014Poor Betty!\u2014A Schoolmistress Censured\u2014Skinner Street\u2014Unpropitious Fortune\u2014William Godwin\u2014An Original Married Life.\n\nMany interesting associations\u2014Principally, however, connected with the annals of crime and the execution of the laws of England\u2014belong to the Church of St. Sepulchre, or St. 'Pulchre. This sacred edifice\u2014anciently known as St. Sepulchre's in the Bailey, or by Chamberlain Gate (now Newgate)\u2014stands at the eastern end of the slight acclivity of Snow Hill, and between Smithfield and the Old Bailey. The genuine materials for its early history are scanty enough. It was probably founded about the commencement of the twelfth century, but of the exact date and circumstances of its origin there is no record whatever. Its name is derived from the Holy Sepulchre of our Saviour at Jerusalem, to the memory of which it was first dedicated.\n\nThe earliest authentic notice of the church, according to Maitland, is of the year 1178, at which date it was given by Roger, Bishop of Sarum, to the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew. These held the right of advowson until the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., and from that time until 1610 it remained in the hands of the Crown. James I., however, then granted &quot;the rectory and its appurtenances, with the advowson of the vicarage,&quot; to Francis Phillips and others. The next stage in its history is that the rectory was purchased by the parishioners, to be held in fee-farm of the Crown, and the advowson was obtained by the President and Fellows of St. John the Baptist College, at Oxford.\n\nThe church was rebuilt about the middle of the fifteenth century, when one of the Popham family, who had been Chancellor of Normandy and Treasurer of the King's Household, with distinguished liberality erected a handsome chapel on the south side of the choir, and the very beautiful porch still remaining at the south-west corner of the building. &quot;His image,&quot; Stow says, &quot;fair graven in stone, was fixed over the said porch.&quot;\n\nThe dreadful fire of 1666 almost destroyed St. Sepulchre's, but the parishioners set energetically to work, and it was &quot;rebuilt and beautified both within and without.&quot; The general reparation was under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, and nothing but the walls of the old building, and these not entirely, were suffered to remain. The work was done rapidly, and the whole was completed within four years.\n\n&quot;The tower,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;retained its original aspect, and the body of the church, after its restoration, presented a series of windows between buttresses, with pointed heads filled with tracery, crowned by a string-course and battlements. In this form it remained till the year 1790, when it appears the whole fabric was found to be in a state of great decay, and it was resolved to repair it throughout. Accordingly the walls of the church were cased with Portland stone, and all the windows were taken out and replaced by others with plain semi-circular heads, as now seen\u2014certainly agreeing but badly with the tower and porch of the building, but according with the then prevailing spirit of economy. The battlements, too, were taken down, and a plain stone parapet was substituted, so that at this time (with the exception of the roof, which was wagon-headed, and presented on the outside an unsightly swell, visible above the parapet) the church assumed its present appearance.&quot; The ungainly roof was removed, and an entirely new one erected, about 1836.\n\nAt each corner of the tower\u2014&quot;one of the most ancient,&quot; says the author of &quot;Londinium Redivivum,&quot; &quot;in the outline of the circuit of London&quot; \u2014there are spires, and on the spires there are weathercocks. These have been made use of by Howell to point a moral: &quot;Unreasonable people,&quot; says he, &quot;are as hard to reconcile as the vanes of St. Sepulchre's tower, which never look all four upon one point of the heavens.&quot; Nothing can be said with certainty as to the date of the tower, but it is not without the bounds of probability that it formed part of the original building. The belfry is reached by a small winding staircase in the south-west angle, and a similar staircase in an opposite angle leads to the summit. The spires at the corners, and some of the tower windows, have very recently undergone several alterations, which have added much to the picturesqueness and beauty of the church.\n\nThe chief entrance to St. Sepulchre's is by a porch of singular beauty, projecting from the south side of the tower, at the western end of the church. The groining of the ceiling of this porch, it has been pointed out, takes an almost unique form; the ribs are carved in bold relief, and the bosses at the intersections represent angels' heads, shields, roses, &amp;c., in great variety.\n\nComing now to the interior of the church, we find it divided into three aisles, by two ranges of Tuscan columns. The aisles are of unequal widths, that in the centre being the widest, that to the south the narrowest. Semi-circular arches connect the columns on either side, springing directly from their capitals, without the interposition of an entablature, and support a large dental cornice, extending round the church. The ceiling of the middle aisle is divided into seven compartments, by horizontal bands, the middle compartment being formed into a small dome.\n\nThe aisles have groined ceilings, ornamented at the angles with doves, &amp;c., and beneath every division of the groining are small windows, to admit light to the galleries. Over each of the aisles there is a gallery, very clumsily introduced, which dates from the time when the church was built by Wren, and extends the whole length, excepting at the chancel. The front of the gallery, which is of oak, is described by Mr. Godwin as carved into scrolls, branches, &amp;c., in the centre panel, on either side, with the initials &quot;C. R.,&quot; enriched with carvings of laurel, which have, however, he says, &quot;but little merit.&quot;\n\nAt the east end of the church there are three semicircular-headed windows. Beneath the centre one is a large Corinthian altar-piece of oak, displaying columns, entablatures, &amp;c., elaborately carved and gilded.\n\nThe length of the church, exclusive of the ambulatory, is said to be 126 feet, the breadth 68 feet, and the height of the tower 140 feet.\n\nA singularly ugly sounding-board, extending over the preacher, used to stand at the back of the pulpit, at the east end of the church. It was in the shape of a large parabolic reflector, about twelve feet in diameter, and was composed of ribs of mahogany.\n\nAt the west end of the church there is a large organ, said to be the oldest and one of the finest in London. It was built in 1677, and has been greatly enlarged. Its reed-stops (hautboy, clarinet, &amp;c.) are supposed to be unrivalled. In Newcourt's time the church was taken notice of as &quot;remarkable for possessing an exceedingly fine organ, and the playing is thought so beautiful, that large congregations are attracted, though some of the parishioners object to the mode of performing divine service.&quot;\n\nOn the north side of the church, Mr. Godwin mentions, is a large apartment known as &quot;St. Stephen's Chapel.&quot; This building evidently formed a somewhat important part of the old church, and was probably appropriated to the votaries of the saint whose name it bears.\n\nBetween the exterior and the interior of the church there is little harmony. &quot;For example,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;the columns which form the south aisle face, in some instances, the centre of the large windows which occur in the external wall of the church, and in others the centre of the piers, indifferently.&quot; This discordance may likely enough have arisen from the fact that when the church was rebuilt, or rather restored, after the Great Fire, the works were done without much attention from Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nSt. Sepulchre's appears to have enjoyed considerable popularity from the earliest period of its history, if one is to judge from the various sums left by well-disposed persons for the support of certain fraternities founded in the church\u2014namely, those of St. Katherine, St. Michael, St. Anne, and Our Lady\u2014and by others, for the maintenance of chantry priests to celebrate masses at stated intervals for the good of their souls. One of the fraternities just named\u2014that of St. Katherine\u2014 originated, according to Stow, in the devotion of some poor persons in the parish, and was in honour of the conception of the Virgin Mary. They met in the church on the day of the Conception, and there had the mass of the day, and offered to the same, and provided a certain chaplain daily to celebrate divine service, and to set up wax lights before the image belonging to the fraternity, on all festival days.\n\nThe most famous of all who have been interred in St. Sepulchre's is Roger Ascham, the author of the &quot;Schoolmaster,&quot; and the instructor of Queen Elizabeth in Greek and Latin. This learned old worthy was born in 1515, near Northallerton, in Yorkshire. He was educated at Cambridge University, and in time rose to be the university orator, being notably zealous in promoting what was then a novelty in England\u2014the study of the Greek language. To divert himself after the fatigue of severe study, he used to devote himself to archery. This drew down upon him the censure of the all-work-and-no-play school; and in defence of himself, Ascham, in 1545, published &quot;Toxophilus,&quot; a treatise on his favourite sport. This book is even yet well worthy of perusal, for its enthusiasm, and for its curious descriptions of the personal appearance and manners of the principal persons whom the author had seen and conversed with. Henry VIII. rewarded him with a pension of \u00a310 per annum, a considerable sum in those days. In 1548, Ascham, on the death of William Grindall, who had been his pupil, was appointed instructor in the learned languages to Lady Elizabeth, afterwards the good Queen Bess. At the end of two years he had some dispute with, or took a disgust at, Lady Elizabeth's attendants, resigned his situation, and returned to his college. Soon after this he was employed as secretary to the English ambassador at the court of Charles V. of Germany, and remained abroad till the death of Edward VI. During his absence he had been appointed Latin secretary to King Edward. Strangely enough, though Queen Mary and her ministers were Papists, and Ascham a Protestant, he was retained in his office of Latin secretary, his pension was increased to \u00a320, and he was allowed to retain his fellowship and his situation as university orator. In 1554 he married a lady of good family, by whom he had a considerable fortune, and of whom, in writing to a friend, he gives, as might perhaps be expected, an excellent character. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, she not only required his services as Latin secretary, but as her instructor in Greek, and he resided at Court during the remainder of his life. He died in consequence of his endeavours to complete a Latin poem which he intended to present to the queen on the New Year's Day of 1569. He breathed his last two days before 1568 ran out, and was interred, according to his own directions, in the most private manner, in St. Sepulchre's Church, his funeral sermon being preached by Dr. Andrew Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's. He was universally lamented; and even the queen herself not only showed great concern, but was pleased to say that she would rather have lost ten thousand pounds than her tutor Ascham, which, from that somewhat closehanded sovereign, was truly an expression of high regard.\n\nAscham, like most men, had his little weaknesses. He had too great a propensity to dice and cock-fighting. Bishop Nicholson would try to convince us that this is an unfounded calumny, but, as it is mentioned by Camden, and other contemporary writers, it seems impossible to deny it. He died, from all accounts, in indifferent circumstances. &quot;Whether,&quot; says Dr. Johnson, referring to this, &quot;Ascham was poor by his own fault, or the fault of others, cannot now be decided; but it is certain that many have been rich with less merit. His philological learning would have gained him honour in any country; and among us it may justly call for that reverence which all nations owe to those who first rouse them from ignorance, and kindle among them the light of literature.&quot; His most valuable work, &quot;The Schoolmaster,&quot; was published by his widow. The nature of this celebrated performance may be gathered from the title: &quot;The Schoolmaster; or a plain and perfite way of teaching children to understand, write, and speak the Latin tongue. \u2026 And commodious also for all such as have forgot the Latin tongue, and would by themselves, without a schoolmaster, in short time, and with small pains, recover a sufficient habilitie to understand, write, and speak Latin: by Roger Ascham, ann. 1570. At London, printed by John Daye, dwelling over Aldersgate,&quot; a printer, by the way, already mentioned by us a few chapters back (see page 208), as having printed several noted works of the sixteenth century.\n\nDr. Johnson remarks that the instruction recommended in &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot; is perhaps the best ever given for the study of languages.\n\nHere also lies buried Captain John Smith, a conspicuous soldier of fortune, whose romantic adventures and daring exploits have rarely been surpassed. He died on the 21st of June, 1631. This valiant captain was born at Willoughby, in the county of Lincoln, and helped by his doings to enliven the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. He had a share in the wars of Hungary in 1602, and in three single combats overcame three Turks, and cut off their heads. For this, and other equally brave deeds, Sigismund, Duke of Transylvania, gave him his picture set in gold, with a pension of three hundred ducats; and allowed him to bear three Turks' heads proper as his shield of arms. He afterwards went to America, where he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Indians. He escaped from them, however, at last, and resumed his brilliant career by hazarding his life in naval engagements with pirates and Spanish men-of-war. The most important act of his life was the share he had in civilising the natives of New England, and reducing that province to obedience to Great Britain. In connection with his tomb in St. Sepulchre's, he is mentioned by Stow, in his &quot;Survey,&quot; as &quot;some time Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New England.&quot;\n\nCertainly the most interesting events of his chequered career were his capture by the Indians, and the saving of his life by the Indian girl Pocahontas, a story of adventure that charms as often as it is told. Bancroft, the historian of the United States, relates how, during the early settlement of Virginia, Smith left the infant colony on an exploring expedition, and not only ascended the river Chickahominy, but struck into the interior. His companions disobeyed his instructions, and being surprised by the Indians, were put to death. Smith preserved his own life by calmness and self-possession. Displaying a pocket-compass, he amused the savages by an explanation of its power, and increased their admiration of his superior genius by imparting to them some vague conceptions of the form of the earth, and the nature of the planetary system. To the Indians, who retained him as their prisoner, his captivity was a more strange event than anything of which the traditions of their tribes preserved the memory. He was allowed to send a letter to the fort at Jamestown, and the savage wonder was increased, for he seemed by some magic to endow the paper with the gift of intelligence. It was evident that their captive was a being of a high order, and then the question arose, Was his nature beneficent, or was he to be dreaded as a dangerous enemy? Their minds were bewildered, and the decision of his fate was referred to the chief Powhatan, and before Powhatan Smith was brought. &quot;The fears of the feeble aborigines,&quot; says Bancroft, &quot;were about to prevail, and his immediate death, already repeatedly threatened and repeatedly delayed, would have been inevitable, but for the timely intercession of Pocahontas, a girl twelve years old, the daughter of Powhatan, whose confiding fondness Smith had easily won, and who firmly clung to his neck, as his head was bowed down to receive the stroke of the tomahawks. His fearlessness, and her entreaties, persuaded the council to spare the agreeable stranger, who could make hatchets for her father, and rattles and strings of beads for herself, the favourite child. The barbarians, whose decision had long been held in suspense by the mysterious awe which Smith had inspired, now resolved to receive him as a friend, and to make him a partner of their councils. They tempted him to join their bands, and lend assistance in an attack upon the white men at Jamestown; and when his decision of character succeeded in changing the current of their thoughts, they dismissed him with mutual promises of friendship and benevolence. Thus the captivity of Smith did itself become a benefit to the colony; for he had not only observed with care the country between the James and the Potomac, and had gained some knowledge of the language and manners of the natives, but he now established a peaceful intercourse between the English and the tribes of Powhatan.&quot;\n\nOn the monument erected to Smith in St. Sepulchre's Church, the following quaint lines were formerly inscribed:\u2014\n\n&quot;Here lies one conquered that hath conquered kings,\nSubdued large territories, and done things\nWhich to the world impossible would seem,\nBut that the truth is held in more esteem.\nShall I report his former service done,\nIn honour of his God, and Christendom?\nHow that he did divide, from pagans three,\nTheir heads and lives, types of his chivalry?\u2014\nFor which great service, in that climate done,\nBrave Sigismundus, King of Hungarion,\nDid give him, as a coat of arms, to wear\nThese conquered heads, got by his sword and spear.\nOr shall I tell of his adventures since\nDone in Virginia, that large continent?\nHow that he subdued kings unto his yoke,\nAnd made those heathens flee, as wind doth smoke;\nAnd made their land, being so large a station,\nAn habitation for our Christian nation,\nWhere God is glorified, their wants supplied;\nWhich else for necessaries, must have died.\nBut what avails his conquests, now he lies\nInterred in earth, a prey to worms and flies?\nOh! may his soul in sweet Elysium sleep,\nUntil the Keeper, that all souls doth keep,\nReturn to judgment; and that after thence\nWith angels he may have his recompense.&quot;\n\nSir Robert Peake, the engraver, also found a last resting-place here. He is known as the master of William Faithorne\u2014the famous English engraver of the seventeenth century\u2014and governor of Basing House for the king during the Civil War under Charles I. He died in 1667. Here also was interred the body of Dr. Bell, grandfather of the originator of a well-known system of education.\n\n&quot;The churchyard of St. Sepulchre's,&quot; we learn from Maitland, &quot;at one time extended so far into the street on the south side of the church, as to render the passage-way dangerously narrow. In 1760 the churchyard was, in consequence, levelled, and thrown open to the public. But this led to much inconvenience, and it was re-enclosed in 1802.&quot;\n\nSarah Malcolm, the murderess, was buried in the churchyard of St. Sepulchre's in 1733. This coldhearted and keen-eyed monster in human form has had her story told by us already. The parishioners seem, on this occasion, to have had no such scruples as had been exhibited by their predecessors a hundred and fifty years previous at the burial of Awfield, a traitor. We shall see presently that in those more remote days they were desirous of having at least respectable company for their deceased relatives and friends in the churchyard.\n\n&quot;For a long period,&quot; says Mr. Godwin (1838), &quot;the church was surrounded by low mean buildings, by which its general appearance was hidden; but these having been cleared away, and the neighbourhood made considerably more open, St. Sepulchre's now forms a somewhat pleasing object, notwithstanding that the tower and a part of the porch are so entirely dissimilar in style to the remainder of the building.&quot; And since Godwin's writing the surroundings of the church have been so improved that perhaps few buildings in the metropolis stand more prominently before the public eye.\n\nIn the glorious roll of martyrs who have suffered at the stake for their religious principles, a vicar of St. Sepulchre's, the Reverend John Rogers, occupies a conspicuous place. He was the first who was burned in the reign of the Bloody Mary. This eminent person had at one time been chaplain to the English merchants at Antwerp, and while residing in that city had aided Tindal and Coverdale in their great work of translating the Bible. He married a German lady of good position, by whom he had a large family, and was enabled, by means of her relations, to reside in peace and safety in Germany. It appeared to be his duty, however, to return to England, and there publicly profess and advocate his religious convictions, even at the risk of death. He crossed the sea; he took his place in the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross; he preached a fearless and animated sermon, reminding his astonished audience of the pure and wholesome doctrine which had been promulgated from that pulpit in the days of the good King Edward, and solemnly warning them against the pestilent idolatry and superstition of these new times. It was his last sermon. He was apprehended, tried, condemned, and burned at Smithfield. We described, when speaking of Smithfield, the manner in which he met his fate.\n\nConnected with the martyrdom of Rogers an odd circumstance is quoted in the &quot;Churches of London.&quot; It is stated that when the bishops had resolved to put to death Joan Bocher, a friend came to Rogers and earnestly entreated his influence that the poor woman's life might be spared, and other means taken to prevent the spread of her heterodox doctrines. Rogers, however, contended that she should be executed; and his friend then begged him to choose some other kind of death, which should be more agreeable to the gentleness and mercy prescribed in the gospel. &quot;No,&quot; replied Rogers, &quot;burning alive is not a cruel death, but easy enough.&quot; His friend hearing these words, expressive of so little regard for the sufferings of a fellow-creature, answered him with great vehemence, at the same time striking Rogers' hand, &quot;Well, it may perhaps so happen that you yourself shall have your hands full of this mild burning.&quot; There is no record of Rogers among the papers belonging to St. Sepulchre's, but this may easily be accounted for by the fact that at the Great Fire of 1666 nearly all the registers and archives were destroyed.\n\nA noteworthy incident in the history of St. Sepulchre's was connected with the execution, in 1585, of Awfield, for &quot;sparcinge abrood certen lewed, sedicious, and traytorous bookes.&quot; &quot;When he was executed,&quot; says Fleetwood, the Recorder, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, July 7th of that year, &quot;his body was brought unto St. Pulcher's to be buryed, but the parishioners would not suffer a traytor's corpse to be laid in the earth where their parents, wives, children, kindred, masters, and old neighbours did rest; and so his carcass was returned to the burial-ground near Tyburn, and there I leave it.&quot;\n\nAnother event in the history of the church is a tale of suicide. On the 10th of April, 1600, a man named William Dorrington threw himself from the roof of the tower, leaving there a prayer for forgiveness.\n\nWe come now to speak of the connection of St. Sepulchre's with the neighbouring prison of Newgate. Being the nearest church to the prison, that connection naturally was intimate. Its clock served to give the time to the hangman when there was an execution in the Old Bailey, and many a poor wretch's last moments must it have regulated.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the altar a board with a list of charitable donations and gifts used to contain the following item:\u2014&quot;1605. Mr. Robert Dowe gave, for ringing the greatest bell in this church on the day the condemned prisoners are executed, and for other services, for ever, concerning such condemned prisoners, for which services the sexton is paid \u00a316s. 8d.\u2014\u00a350.\n\nIt was formerly the practice for the clerk or bellman of St. Sepulchre's to go under Newgate, on the night preceding the execution of a criminal, ring his bell, and repeat the following wholesome advice:\u2014\n\n&quot;All you that in the condemned hold do lie,\nPrepare you, for to-morrow you shall die;\nWatch all, and pray, the hour is drawing near\nThat you before the Almighty must appear;\nExamine well yourselves, in time repent,\nThat you may not to eternal flames be sent.\nAnd when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,\nThe Lord above have mercy on your souls.\nPast twelve o'clock!&quot;\n\nThis practice is explained by a passage in Munday's edition of Stow, in which it is told that a Mr. John Dowe, citizen and merchant taylor of London, gave \u00a350 to the parish church of St. Sepulchre's, under the following conditions:\u2014After the several sessions of London, on the night before the execution of such as were condemned to death, the clerk of the church was to go in the night-time, and also early in the morning, to the window of the prison in which they were lying. He was there to ring &quot;certain tolls with a hand-bell&quot; appointed for the purpose, and was afterwards, in a most Christian manner, to put them in mind of their present condition and approaching end, and to exhort them to be prepared, as they ought to be, to die. When they were in the cart, and brought before the walls of the church, the clerk was to stand there ready with the same bell, and, after certain tolls, rehearse a prayer, desiring all the people there present to pray for the unfortunate criminals. The beadle, also, of Merchant Taylors' Hall was allowed an &quot;honest stipend&quot; to see that this ceremony was regularly performed.\n\nThe affecting admonition\u2014&quot;affectingly good,&quot; Pennant calls it\u2014addressed to the prisoners in Newgate, on the night before execution, ran as follows:\u2014\n\n&quot;You prisoners that are within,\nWho, for wickedness and sin,\n\nafter many mercies shown you, are now appointed to die to-morrow in the forenoon; give ear and understand that, to-morrow morning, the greatest bell of St. Sepulchre's shall toll for you, in form and manner of a passing-bell, as used to be tolled for those that are at the point of death; to the end that all godly people, hearing that bell, and knowing it is for your going to your deaths, may be stirred up heartily to pray to God to bestow his grace and mercy upon you, whilst you live. I beseech you, for Jesus Christ's sake, to keep this night in watching and prayer, to the salvation of your own souls while there is yet time and place for mercy; as knowing to-morrow you must appear before the judgment-seat of your Creator, there to give an account of all things done in this life, and to suffer eternal torments for your sins committed against Him, unless, upon your hearty and unfeigned repentance, you find mercy through the merits, death, and passion of your only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return to Him.&quot;\n\nAnd the following was the admonition to condemned criminals, as they were passing by St. Sepulchre's Church wall to execution:\u2014&quot; All good people, pray heartily unto God for these poor sinners, who are now going to their death, for whom this great bell doth toll.\n\n&quot;You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask mercy of the Lord, for the salvation of your own souls, through the [merits, death, and passion of Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto Him.\n\n&quot;Lord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.\nLord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.&quot;\n\nThe charitable Mr. Dowe, who took such interest in the last moments of the occupants of the condemned cell, was buried in the church of St. Botolph, Aldgate.\n\nAnother curious custom observed at St. Sepulchre's was the presentation of a nosegay to every criminal on his way to execution at Tyburn. No doubt the practice had its origin in some kindly feeling for the poor unfortunates who were so soon to bid farewell to all the beauties of earth. One of the last who received a nosegay from the steps of St. Sepulchre's was &quot;Sixteen-string Jack,&quot; alias John Rann, who was hanged, in 1774, for robbing the Rev. Dr. Bell of his watch and eighteen pence in money, in Gunnersbury Lane, on the road to Brentford. Sixteen-string Jack wore the flowers in his button-hole as he rode dolefully to the gallows. This was witnessed by John Thomas Smith, who thus describes the scene in his admirable anecdotebook, &quot;Nollekens and his Times:&quot;\u2014&quot; I remember well, when I was in my eighth year, Mr. Nollekens calling at my father's house, in Great Portland Street, and taking us to Oxford Street, to see the notorious Jack Rann, commonly called Sixteenstring Jack, go to Tyburn to be hanged. \u2026 The criminal was dressed in a pea-green coat, with an immense nosegay in the button-hole, which had been presented to him at St. Sepulchre's steps; and his nankeen small-clothes, we were told, were tied at each knee with sixteen strings. After he had passed, and Mr. Nollekens was leading me home by the hand, I recollect his stooping down to me and observing, in a low tone of voice, 'Tom, now, my little man, if my father-in-law, Mr. Justice Welch, had been high constable, we could have walked by the side of the cart all the way to Tyburn.'&quot;\n\nWhen criminals were conveyed from Newgate to Tyburn, the cart passed up Giltspur Street, and through Smithfield, to Cow Lane. Skinner Street had not then been built, and the Crooked Lane which turned down by St. Sepulchre's, as well as Ozier Lane, did not afford sufficient width to admit of the cavalcade passing by either of them, with convenience, to Holborn Hill, or &quot;the Heavy Hill,&quot; as it used to be called. The procession seems at no time to have had much of the solemn element about it. &quot;The heroes of the day were often,&quot; says a popular writer, &quot;on good terms with the mob, and jokes were exchanged between the men who were going to be hanged and the men who deserved to be.&quot;\n\n&quot;On St. Paul's Day,&quot; says Mr. Timbs (1868), &quot;service is performed in St. Sepulchre's, in accordance with the will of Mr. Paul Jervis, who, in 1717, devised certain land in trust that a sermon should be preached in the church upon every Paul's Day upon the excellence of the liturgy o the Church of England; the preacher to receive 40s. for such sermon. Various sums are also bequeathed to the curate, the clerk, the treasurer, and masters of the parochial schools. To the poor of the parish he bequeathed 20s. a-piece to ten of the poorest householders within that part of the parish of St. Sepulchre commonly called Smithfield quarter, \u00a34 to the treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and 6s. 8d. yearly to the clerk, who shall attend to receive the same. The residue of the yearly rents and profits is to be distributed unto and amongst such poor people of the parish of St. Sepulchre's, London, who shall attend the service and sermon. At the close of the service the vestry-clerk reads aloud an extract from the will, and then proceeds to the distribution of the money. In the evening the vicar, churchwardens, and common councilmen of the precinct dine together.&quot;\n\nIn 1749, a Mr. Drinkwater made a praiseworthy bequest. He left the parish of St. Sepulchre \u00a3500 to be lent in sums of \u00a325 to industrious young tradesmen. No interest was to be charged, and the money was to be lent for four years.\n\nNext to St. Sepulchre's, on Snow Hill, used to stand the famous old inn of the &quot;Saracen's Head.&quot; It was only swept away within the last few years by the ruthless army of City improvers: a view of it in course of demolition was given on page 439. It was one of the oldest of the London inns which bore the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; for a sign. One of Dick Tarlton's jests makes mention of the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; without Newgate, and Stow, describing this neighbourhood, speaks particularly of &quot;a fair large inn for receipt of travellers&quot; that &quot;hath to sign the 'Saracen's Head.'&quot; The courtyard had, to the last, many of the characteristics of an old English inn; there were galleries all round leading to the bedrooms, and a spacious gateway through which the dusty mail-coaches used to rumble, the tired passengers creeping forth &quot;thanking their stars in having escaped the highwaymen and the holes and sloughs of the road.&quot; Into that courtyard how many have come on their first arrival in London with hearts beating high with hope, some of whom have risen to be aldermen and sit in state as lord mayor, whilst others have gone the way of the idle apprentice and come to a sad end at Tyburn! It was at this inn that Nicholas Nickleby and his uncle waited upon the Yorkshire schoolmaster Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall. Mr. Dickens describes the tavern as it existed in the last days of mail-coaching, when it was a most important place for arrivals and departures in London:\u2014\n\n&quot;Next to the jail, and by consequence near to Smithfield also, and the Compter and the bustle and noise of the City, and just on that particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastwards seriously think of falling down on purpose, and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westwards not unfrequently fall by accident, is the coach-yard of the 'Saracen's Head' inn, its portals guarded by two Saracen's heads and shoulders, which it was once the pride and glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night, but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity, possibly because this species of humour is now confined to St. James's parish, where doorknockers are preferred as being more portable, and bell-wires esteemed as convenient tooth-picks. Whether this be the reason or not, there they are, frowning upon you from each side of the gateway; and the inn itself, garnished with another Saracen's head, frowns upon you from the top of the yard; while from the door of the hind-boot of all the red coaches that are standing therein, there glares a small Saracen's head with a twin expression to the large Saracen's head below, so that the general appearance of the pile is of the Saracenic order.&quot;\n\nTo explain the use of the Saracen's head as an inn sign various reasons have been given. &quot;When our countrymen,&quot; says Selden, &quot;came home from fighting with the Saracens and were beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible faces (as you still see the 'Saracen's Head' is), when in truth they were like other men. But this they did to save their own credit.&quot; Or the sign may have been adopted by those who had visited the Holy Land either as pilgrims or to fight the Saracens. Others, again, hold that it was first set up in compliment to the mother of Thomas \u00e0 Becket, who was the daughter of a Saracen. However this may be, it is certain that the use of the sign in former days was very general.\n\nRunning past the east end of St. Sepulchre's, from Newgate into West Smithfield, is Giltspur Street, anciently called Knightriders Street. This interesting thoroughfare derives its name from the knights with their gilt spurs having been accustomed to ride this way to the jousts and tournaments which in days of old were held in Smithfield.\n\nIn this street was Giltspur Street Compter, a debtors' prison and house of correction appertaining to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex. It stood over against St. Sepulchre's Church, and was removed hither from the east side of Wood Street, Cheapside, in 1791. At the time of its removal it was used as a place of imprisonment for debtors, but the yearly increasing demands upon the contracted space caused that department to be given up, and City debtors were sent to Whitecross Street. The architect was Dance, to whom we are also indebted for the grim pile of Newgate. The Compter was a dirty and appropriately convictlooking edifice. It was pulled down in 1855. Mr. Hepworth Dixon gave an interesting account of this City House of Correction, not long before its demolition, in his &quot;London Prisons&quot; (1850). &quot;Entering,&quot; he says, &quot;at the door facing St. Sepulchre's, the visitor suddenly finds himself in a low dark passage, leading into the offices of the gaol, and branching off into other passages, darker, closer, more replete with noxious smells, than even those of Newgate. This is the fitting prelude to what follows. The prison, it must be noticed, is divided into two principal divisions, the House of Correction and the Compter. The front in Giltspur Street, and the side nearest to Newgate Street, is called the Compter. In its wards are placed detenues of various kinds\u2014remands, committals from the police-courts, and generally persons waiting for trial, and consequently still unconvicted. The other department, the House of Correction, occupies the back portion of the premises, abutting on Christ's Hospital. Curious it is to consider how thin a wall divides these widely-separate worlds! And sorrowful it is to think what a difference of destiny awaits the children\u2014destiny inexorable, though often unearned in either case\u2014who, on the one side of it or the other, receive an eleemosynary education! The collegian and the criminal! Who shall say how much mere accident\u2014 circumstances over which the child has little power \u2014determines to a life of usefulness or mischief? From the yards of Giltspur Street prison almost the only objects visible, outside of the gaol itself, are the towers of Christ's Hospital; the only sounds audible, the shouts of the scholars at their play. The balls of the hospital boys often fall within the yards of the prison. Whether these sights and sounds ever cause the criminal to pause and reflect upon the courses of his life, we will not say, but the stranger visiting the place will be very apt to think for him. \u2026\n\n&quot;In the department of the prison called the House of Correction, minor offenders within the City of London are imprisoned. No transports are sent hither, nor is any person whose sentence is above three years in length.&quot; This able writer then goes on to tell of the many crying evils connected with the institution\u2014the want of air, the over-crowded state of the rooms, the absence of proper cellular accommodation, and the vicious intercourse carried on amongst the prisoners. The entire gaol, when he wrote, only contained thirty-six separate sleeping-rooms. Now by the highest prison calculation\u2014and this, be it noted, proceeds on the assumption that three persons can sleep in small, miserable, unventilated cells, which are built for only one, and are too confined for that, being only about one-half the size of the model cell for one at Pentonville\u2014it was only capable of accommodating 203 prisoners, yet by the returns issued at Michaelmas, 1850, it contained 246!\n\nA large section of the prison used to be devoted to female delinquents, but lately it was almost entirely given up to male offenders.\n\n&quot;The House of Correction, and the Compter portion of the establishment,&quot; says Mr. Dixon, &quot;are kept quite distinct, but it would be difficult to award the palm of empire in their respective facilities for demoralisation. We think the Compter rather the worse of the two. You are shown into a room, about the size of an apartment in an ordinary dwelling-house, which will be found crowded with from thirty to forty persons, young and old, and in their ordinary costume; the low thief in his filth and rags, and the member of the swell-mob with his bright buttons, flash finery, and false jewels. Here you notice the boy who has just been guilty of his first offence, and committed for trial, learning with a greedy mind a thousand criminal arts, and listening with the precocious instinct of guilty passions to stories and conversations the most depraved and disgusting. You regard him with a mixture of pity and loathing, for he knows that the eyes of his peers are upon him, and he stares at you with a familiar impudence, and exhibits a devil-may-care countenance, such as is only to be met with in the juvenile offender. Here, too, may be seen the young clerk, taken up on suspicion\u2014perhaps innocent\u2014who avoids you with a shy look of pain and uneasiness: what a hell must this prison be to him! How frightful it is to think of a person really untainted with crime, compelled to herd for ten or twenty days with these abandoned wretches!\n\n&quot;On the other, the House of Correction side of the gaol, similar rooms will be found, full of prisoners communicating with each other, laughing and shouting without hindrance. All this is so little in accordance with existing notions of prison discipline, that one is continually fancying these disgraceful scenes cannot be in the capital of England, and in the year of grace 1850. Very few of the prisoners attend school or receive any instruction; neither is any kind of employment afforded them, except oakum-picking, and the still more disgusting labour of the treadmill. When at work, an officer is in attendance to prevent disorderly conduct; but his presence is of no avail as a protection to the less depraved. Conversation still goes on; and every facility is afforded for making acquaintances, and for mutual contamination.&quot;\n\nAfter having long been branded by intelligent inspectors as a disgrace to the metropolis, Giltspur Street Compter was condemned, closed in 1854, and subsequently taken down.\n\nNearly opposite what used to be the site of the Compter, and adjoining Cock Lane, is the spot called Pie Corner, near which terminated the Great Fire of 1666. The fire commenced at Pudding Lane, it will be remembered, so it was singularly appropriate that it should terminate at Pie Corner. Under the date of 4th September, 1666, Pepys, in his &quot;Diary,&quot; records that &quot;W. Hewer this day went to see how his mother did, and comes home late, telling us how he hath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in Pye Corner being burned; so that the fire is got so far that way.&quot; The figure of a fat naked boy stands over a public house at the corner of the lane; it used to have the following warning inscription attached:\u2014 &quot;This boy is in memory put up of the late fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony, 1666.&quot; According to Stow, Pie Corner derived its name from the sign of a well-frequented hostelry, which anciently stood on the spot. Strype makes honourable mention of Pie Corner, as &quot;noted chiefly for cooks' shops and pigs dressed there during Bartholomew Fair.&quot; Our old writers have many references\u2014and not all, by the way, in the best taste\u2014to its cookstalls and dressed pork. Shadwell, for instance, in the Woman Captain (1680) speaks of &quot;meat dressed at Pie Corner by greasy scullions;&quot; and Ben Jonson writes in the Alchemist (1612)\u2014\n\n&quot;I shall put you in mind, sir, at Pie Corner,\nTaking your meal of steam in from cooks' stalls.&quot;\n\nAnd in &quot;The Great Boobee&quot; (&quot;Roxburgh Ballads&quot;):\n\n&quot;Next day I through Pie Corner passed;\nThe roast meat on the stall\nInvited me to take a taste;\nMy money was but small.&quot;\n\nBut Pie Corner seems to have been noted for more than eatables. A ballad from Tom D'Urfey's &quot;Pills to Purge Melancholy,&quot; describing Bartholomew Fair, eleven years before the Fire of London, says:\u2014\n\n&quot;At Pie-Corner end, mark well my good friend,\n'Tis a very fine dirty place;\nWhere there's more arrows and bows. \u2026\nThan was handled at Chivy Chase.&quot;\n\nWe have already given a view of Pie Corner in our chapter on Smithfield, page 361.\n\nHosier Lane, running from Cow Lane to Smithfield, and almost parallel to Cock Lane, is described by &quot;R. B.,&quot; in Strype, as a place not over-well built or inhabited. The houses were all old timber erections. Some of these\u2014those standing at the south corner of the lane\u2014were in the beginning of this century depicted by Mr. J. T. Smith, in his &quot;Ancient Topography of London.&quot; He describes them as probably of the reign of James I. The rooms were small, with low, unornamented ceilings; the timber, oak, profusely used; the gables were plain, and the walls lath and plaster. They were taken down in 1809.\n\nIn the corner house, in Mr. Smith's time, there was a barber whose name was Catchpole; at least, so it was written over the door. He was rather an odd fellow, and possessed, according to his own account, a famous relic of antiquity. He would gravely show his customers a short-bladed instrument, as the identical dagger with which Walworth killed Wat Tyler.\n\nHosier Lane, like Pie Corner, used to be a great resort during the time of Bartholomew Fair, &quot;all the houses,&quot; it is said in Strype, &quot;generally being made public for tippling.&quot;\n\nWe return now from our excursion to the north of St. Sepulchre's, and continue our rambles to the west, and before speaking of what is, let us refer to what has been.\n\nTurnagain Lane is not far from this. &quot;Near unto this Seacoal Lane,&quot; remarks Stow, &quot;in the turning towards Holborn Conduit, is Turnagain Lane, or rather, as in a record of the 5th of Edward III., Windagain Lane, for that it goeth down west to Fleet Dyke, from whence men must turn again the same way they came, but there it stopped.&quot; There used to be a proverb, &quot;He must take him a house in Turnagain Lane.&quot;\n\nA conduit formerly stood on Snow Hill, a little below the church. It is described as a building with four equal sides, ornamented with four columns and pediment, surmounted by a pyramid, on which stood a lamb\u2014a rebus on the name of Lamb, from whose conduit in Red Lion Street the water came. There had been a conduit there, however, before Lamb's day, which was towards the close of the sixteenth century.\n\nAt No. 37, King Street, Snow Hill, there used to be a ladies' charity school, which was established in 1702, and remained in the parish 145 years. Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale were subscribers to this school, and Johnson drew from it his story of Betty Broom, in &quot;The Idler.&quot; The world of domestic service, in Betty's days, seems to have been pretty much as now. Betty was a poor girl, bred in the country at a charity-school, maintained by the contributions of wealthy neighbours. The patronesses visited the school from time to time, to see how the pupils got on, and everything went well, till &quot;at last, the chief of the subscribers having passed a winter in London, came down full of an opinion new and strange to the whole country. She held it little less than criminal to teach poor girls to read and write. They who are born to poverty, she said, are born to ignorance, and will work the harder the less they know. She told her friends that London was in confusion by the insolence of servants; that scarcely a girl could be got for all-work, since education had made such numbers of fine ladies, that nobody would now accept a lower title than that of a waiting-maid, or something that might qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles, and to sit at work in the parlour window. But she was resolved, for her part, to spoil no more girls. Those who were to live by their hands should neither read nor write out of her pocket. The world was bad enough already, and she would have no part in making it worse.\n\n&quot;She was for a long time warmly opposed; but she persevered in her notions, and withdrew her subscription. Few listen, without a desire of conviction, to those who advise them to spare their money. Her example and her arguments gained ground daily; and in less than a year the whole parish was convinced that the nation would be ruined if the children of the poor were taught to read and write.&quot; So the school was dissolved, and Betty with the rest was turned adrift into the wide and cold world; and her adventures there any one may read in &quot;The Idler&quot; for himself.\n\nThere is an entry in the school minutes of 1763, to the effect that the ladies of the committee censured the schoolmistress for listening to the story of the Cock Lane ghost, and &quot;desired her to keep her belief in the article to herself.&quot;\n\nSkinner Street\u2014now one of the names of the past\u2014which ran by the south side of St. Sepulchre's, and formed the connecting link between Newgate Street and Holborn, received its name from Alderman Skinner, through whose exertions, about 1802, it was principally built. The following account of Skinner Street is from the picturesque pen of Mr. William Harvey (&quot;Aleph&quot;), whose long familiarity with the places he describes renders doubly valuable his many contributions to the history of London scenes and people:\u2014&quot;As a building speculation,&quot; he says, writing in 1863, &quot;it was a failure. When the buildings were ready for occupation, tall and substantial as they really were, the high rents frightened intending shopkeepers. Tenants were not to be had; and in order to get over the money difficulty, a lottery, sanctioned by Parliament, was commenced. Lotteries were then common tricks of finance, and nobody wondered at the new venture; but even the most desperate fortune-hunters were slow to invest their capital, and the tickets hung sadly on hand. The day for the drawing was postponed several times, and when it came, there was little or no excitement on the subject, and whoever rejoiced in becoming a house-owner on such easy terms, the original projectors and builders were understood to have suffered considerably. The winners found the property in a very unfinished condition. Few of the dwellings were habitable, and as funds were often wanting, a majority of the houses remained empty, and the shops unopened. After two or three years things began to improve; the vast many-storeyed house which then covered the site of Commercial Place was converted into a warehousing dep\u00f4t; a capital house opposite the 'Saracen's Head' was taken by a hosier of the name of Theobald, who, opening his shop with the determination of selling the best hosiery, and nothing else, was able to convince the citizens that his hose was first-rate, and, desiring only a living profit, succeeded, after thirty years of unwearied industry, in accumulating a large fortune. Theobald was possessed of literary tastes, and at the sale of Sir Walter Scott's manuscripts was a liberal purchaser. He also collected a library of exceedingly choice books, and when aristocratic customers purchased stockings of him, was soon able to interest them in matters of far higher interest\u2026\n\n&quot;The most remarkable shop\u2014but it was on the left-hand side, at a corner house\u2014was that established for the sale of children's books. It boasted an immense extent of window-front, extending from the entrance into Snow Hill, and towards Fleet Market. Many a time have I lingered with loving eyes over those fascinating story-books, so rich in gaily-coloured prints; such careful editions of the marvellous old histories, 'Puss in Boots,' 'Cock Robin,' 'Cinderella,' and the like. Fortunately the front was kept low, so as exactly to suit the capacity of a childish admirer. . . . . But Skinner Street did not prosper much, and never could compete with even the dullest portions of Holborn. I have spoken of some reputable shops; but you know the proverb, 'One swallow will not make a summer,' and it was a declining neighbourhood almost before it could be called new. In 1810 the commercial dep\u00f4t, which had been erected at a cost of \u00a325,000, and was the chief prize in the lottery, was destroyed by fire, never to be rebuilt\u2014a heavy blow and discouragement to Skinner Street, from which it never rallied. Perhaps the periodical hanging-days exercised an unfavourable influence, collecting, as they frequently did, all the thieves and vagabonds of London. I never sympathised with Pepys or Charles Fox in their passion for public executions, and made it a point to avoid those ghastly sights; but early of a Monday morning, when I had just reached the end of Giltspur Street, a miserable wretch had just been turned off from the platform of the debtors' door, and I was made the unwilling witness of his last struggles. That scene haunted me for months, and I often used to ask myself, 'Who that could help it would live in Skinner Street?' The next unpropitious event in these parts was the unexpected closing of the child's library. What could it mean? Such a well-to-do establishment shut up? Yes, the whole army of shutters looked blankly on the inquirer, and forbade even a single glance at 'Sinbad' or 'Robinson Crusoe.' It would soon be re-opened, we naturally thought; but the shutters never came down again. The whole house was deserted; not even a messenger in bankruptcy, or an ancient Charley, was found to regard the playful double knocks of the neighbouring juveniles. Gradually the glass of all the windows got broken in, a heavy cloud of black dust, solidifying into inches thick, gathered on sills and doors and brickwork, till the whole frontage grew as gloomy as Giant Despair's Castle. Not long after, the adjoining houses shared the same fate, and they remained from year to year without the slightest sign of life\u2014absolute scarecrows, darkening with their uncomfortable shadows the busy streets. Within half a mile, in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, there are (1863) seven houses in a similar predicament\u2014 window-glass demolished, doors cracked from top to bottom, spiders' webs hanging from every projecting sill or parapet. What can it mean? The loss in the article of rents alone must be over \u00a31,000 annually. If the real owners are at feud with imaginary owners, surely the property might be rendered valuable, and the proceeds invested. Even the lawyers can derive no profit from such hopeless abandonment. I am told the whole mischief arose out of a Chancery suit. Can it be the famous 'Jarndyce v. Jarndyce' case? And have all the heirs starved each other out? If so, what hinders our lady the Queen from taking possession? Any change would be an improvement, for these dead houses make the streets they cumber as dispiriting and comfortless as graveyards. Busy fancy will sometimes people them, and fill the dreary rooms with strange guests. Do the victims of guilt congregate in these dark dens? Do wretches 'unfriended by the world or the world's law,' seek refuge in these deserted nooks, mourning in the silence of despair over their former lives, and anticipating the future in unappeasable agony? Such things have been\u2014the silence and desolation of these doomed dwellings make them the more suitable for such tenants.&quot;\n\nA street is nothing without a mystery, so a mystery let these old tumble-down houses remain, whilst we go on to tell that, in front of No. 58, the sailor Cashman was hung in 1817, as we have already mentioned, for plundering a gunsmith's shop there. William Godwin, the author of &quot;Caleb Williams,&quot; kept a bookseller's shop for several years in Skinner Street, at No. 41, and published school-books in the name of Edward Baldwin. On the wall there was a stone carving of \u00c6sop reciting one of his fables to children.\n\nThe most noteworthy event of the life of Godwin was his marriage with the celebrated Mary Wollstonecraft, authoress of a &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women,&quot; whose congenial mind, in politics and morals, he ardently admired. Godwin's account of the way in which they got on together is worth reading:\u2014&quot;Ours,&quot; he writes, &quot;was not an idle happiness, a paradise of selfish and transitory pleasures. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to mention, that influenced by ideas I had long entertained, I engaged an apartment about twenty doors from our house, in the Polygon, Somers Town, which I designed for the purpose of my study and literary occupations. Trifles, however, will be interesting to some readers, when they relate to the last period of the life of such a person as Mary. I will add, therefore, that we were both of us of opinion, that it was possible for two persons to be too uniformly in each other's society. Influenced by that opinion, it was my practice to repair to the apartment I have mentioned as soon as I rose, and frequently not to make my appearance in the Polygon till the hour of dinner. We agreed in condemning the notion, prevalent in many situations in life, that a man and his wife cannot visit in mixed society but in company with each other, and we rather sought occasions of deviating from than of complying with this rule. By this means, though, for the most part, we spent the latter half of each day in one another's society, yet we were in no danger of satiety. We seemed to combine, in a considerable degree, the novelty and lively sensation of a visit with the more delicious and heartfelt pleasure of a domestic life.&quot;\n\nThis philosophic union, to Godwin's inexpressible affliction, did not last more than eighteen months, at the end of which time Mrs. Godwin died, leaving an only daughter, who in the course of time became the second wife of the poet Shelley, and was the author of the wild and extraordinary tale of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116<\/a>"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Jelltex","count_faves":"3","count_comments":"0","can_comment":0,"permissions":{"permcomment":1},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":67,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":160,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":213,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":333,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":427,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":533,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7565\/15781058155_1f916270c0_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":683,"pathalias":"jelltecks"},{"id":"15162536163","owner":"16105638@N00","secret":"3167603025","server":"5611","farm":6,"title":"St Sepulchre Without Newgate, City of London","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"With the rain falling harder, it was a bit of a route march to Holborn and my next church, the stunning St Sepulchre, which was also open.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSt Sepulchre-without-Newgate, also known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Holborn), is an Anglican church in the City of London. It is located on Holborn Viaduct, almost opposite the Old Bailey. In medieval times it stood just outside (&quot;without&quot;) the now-demolished old city wall, near the Newgate. It has been a living of St John's College, Oxford, since 1622.\n\nThe original Saxon church on the site was dedicated to St Edmund the King and Martyr. During the Crusades in the 12th century the church was renamed St Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, in reference to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The name eventually became contracted to St Sepulchre.\n\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the City. It was completely rebuilt in the 15th century but was gutted by the Great Fire of London in 1666,[1] which left only the outer walls, the tower and the porch standing[2] -. Modified in the 18th century, the church underwent extensive restoration in 1878. It narrowly avoided destruction in the Second World War, although the 18th-century watch-house in its churchyard (erected to deter grave-robbers) was completely destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a coffered ceiling[3] installed in 1834. The Vicars' old residence has recently been renovated into a modern living quarter.\n\nDuring the reign of Mary I in 1555, St Sepulchre's vicar, John Rogers, was burned as a heretic.\n\nSt Sepulchre is named in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons as the &quot;bells of Old Bailey&quot;. Traditionally, the great bell would be rung to mark the execution of a prisoner at the nearby gallows at Newgate. The clerk of St Sepulchre's was also responsible for ringing a handbell outside the condemned man's cell in Newgate Prison to inform him of his impending execution. This handbell, known as the Execution Bell, now resides in a glass case to the south of the nave.\n\nThe church has been the official musicians' church for many years and is associated with many famous musicians. Its north aisle (formerly a chapel dedicated to Stephen Harding) is dedicated as the Musicians' Chapel, with four windows commemorating John Ireland, the singer Dame Nellie Melba, Walter Carroll and the conductor Sir Henry Wood respectively.[4] Wood, who &quot;at the age of fourteen, learned to play the organ&quot; at this church [1] and later became its organist, also has his ashes buried in this church.\n\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.[5] The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the City of London Rifles (the 6th Battalion London Regiment). The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate<\/a>\n\nThe Early History of St. Sepulchre's\u2014Its Destruction in 1666\u2014The Exterior and Interior\u2014The Early Popularity of the Church\u2014Interments here\u2014Roger Ascham, the Author of the &quot;Schoolmaster&quot;\u2014Captain John Smith, and his Romantic Adventures\u2014Saved by an Indian Girl\u2014 St. Sepulchre's Churchyard\u2014Accommodation for a Murderess\u2014The Martyr Rogers\u2014An Odd Circumstance\u2014Good Company for the Dead\u2014A Leap from the Tower\u2014A Warning Bell and a Last Admonition\u2014Nosegays for the Condemned\u2014The Route to the Gallows-tree\u2014 The Deeds of the Charitable\u2014The &quot;Saracen's Head&quot;\u2014Description by Dickens\u2014Giltspur Street\u2014Giltspur Street Compter\u2014A Disreputable Condition\u2014Pie Corner\u2014Hosier Lane\u2014A Spurious Relic\u2014The Conduit on Snow Hill\u2014A Ladies' Charity School\u2014Turnagain Lane\u2014Poor Betty!\u2014A Schoolmistress Censured\u2014Skinner Street\u2014Unpropitious Fortune\u2014William Godwin\u2014An Original Married Life.\n\nMany interesting associations\u2014Principally, however, connected with the annals of crime and the execution of the laws of England\u2014belong to the Church of St. Sepulchre, or St. 'Pulchre. This sacred edifice\u2014anciently known as St. Sepulchre's in the Bailey, or by Chamberlain Gate (now Newgate)\u2014stands at the eastern end of the slight acclivity of Snow Hill, and between Smithfield and the Old Bailey. The genuine materials for its early history are scanty enough. It was probably founded about the commencement of the twelfth century, but of the exact date and circumstances of its origin there is no record whatever. Its name is derived from the Holy Sepulchre of our Saviour at Jerusalem, to the memory of which it was first dedicated.\n\nThe earliest authentic notice of the church, according to Maitland, is of the year 1178, at which date it was given by Roger, Bishop of Sarum, to the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew. These held the right of advowson until the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., and from that time until 1610 it remained in the hands of the Crown. James I., however, then granted &quot;the rectory and its appurtenances, with the advowson of the vicarage,&quot; to Francis Phillips and others. The next stage in its history is that the rectory was purchased by the parishioners, to be held in fee-farm of the Crown, and the advowson was obtained by the President and Fellows of St. John the Baptist College, at Oxford.\n\nThe church was rebuilt about the middle of the fifteenth century, when one of the Popham family, who had been Chancellor of Normandy and Treasurer of the King's Household, with distinguished liberality erected a handsome chapel on the south side of the choir, and the very beautiful porch still remaining at the south-west corner of the building. &quot;His image,&quot; Stow says, &quot;fair graven in stone, was fixed over the said porch.&quot;\n\nThe dreadful fire of 1666 almost destroyed St. Sepulchre's, but the parishioners set energetically to work, and it was &quot;rebuilt and beautified both within and without.&quot; The general reparation was under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, and nothing but the walls of the old building, and these not entirely, were suffered to remain. The work was done rapidly, and the whole was completed within four years.\n\n&quot;The tower,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;retained its original aspect, and the body of the church, after its restoration, presented a series of windows between buttresses, with pointed heads filled with tracery, crowned by a string-course and battlements. In this form it remained till the year 1790, when it appears the whole fabric was found to be in a state of great decay, and it was resolved to repair it throughout. Accordingly the walls of the church were cased with Portland stone, and all the windows were taken out and replaced by others with plain semi-circular heads, as now seen\u2014certainly agreeing but badly with the tower and porch of the building, but according with the then prevailing spirit of economy. The battlements, too, were taken down, and a plain stone parapet was substituted, so that at this time (with the exception of the roof, which was wagon-headed, and presented on the outside an unsightly swell, visible above the parapet) the church assumed its present appearance.&quot; The ungainly roof was removed, and an entirely new one erected, about 1836.\n\nAt each corner of the tower\u2014&quot;one of the most ancient,&quot; says the author of &quot;Londinium Redivivum,&quot; &quot;in the outline of the circuit of London&quot; \u2014there are spires, and on the spires there are weathercocks. These have been made use of by Howell to point a moral: &quot;Unreasonable people,&quot; says he, &quot;are as hard to reconcile as the vanes of St. Sepulchre's tower, which never look all four upon one point of the heavens.&quot; Nothing can be said with certainty as to the date of the tower, but it is not without the bounds of probability that it formed part of the original building. The belfry is reached by a small winding staircase in the south-west angle, and a similar staircase in an opposite angle leads to the summit. The spires at the corners, and some of the tower windows, have very recently undergone several alterations, which have added much to the picturesqueness and beauty of the church.\n\nThe chief entrance to St. Sepulchre's is by a porch of singular beauty, projecting from the south side of the tower, at the western end of the church. The groining of the ceiling of this porch, it has been pointed out, takes an almost unique form; the ribs are carved in bold relief, and the bosses at the intersections represent angels' heads, shields, roses, &amp;c., in great variety.\n\nComing now to the interior of the church, we find it divided into three aisles, by two ranges of Tuscan columns. The aisles are of unequal widths, that in the centre being the widest, that to the south the narrowest. Semi-circular arches connect the columns on either side, springing directly from their capitals, without the interposition of an entablature, and support a large dental cornice, extending round the church. The ceiling of the middle aisle is divided into seven compartments, by horizontal bands, the middle compartment being formed into a small dome.\n\nThe aisles have groined ceilings, ornamented at the angles with doves, &amp;c., and beneath every division of the groining are small windows, to admit light to the galleries. Over each of the aisles there is a gallery, very clumsily introduced, which dates from the time when the church was built by Wren, and extends the whole length, excepting at the chancel. The front of the gallery, which is of oak, is described by Mr. Godwin as carved into scrolls, branches, &amp;c., in the centre panel, on either side, with the initials &quot;C. R.,&quot; enriched with carvings of laurel, which have, however, he says, &quot;but little merit.&quot;\n\nAt the east end of the church there are three semicircular-headed windows. Beneath the centre one is a large Corinthian altar-piece of oak, displaying columns, entablatures, &amp;c., elaborately carved and gilded.\n\nThe length of the church, exclusive of the ambulatory, is said to be 126 feet, the breadth 68 feet, and the height of the tower 140 feet.\n\nA singularly ugly sounding-board, extending over the preacher, used to stand at the back of the pulpit, at the east end of the church. It was in the shape of a large parabolic reflector, about twelve feet in diameter, and was composed of ribs of mahogany.\n\nAt the west end of the church there is a large organ, said to be the oldest and one of the finest in London. It was built in 1677, and has been greatly enlarged. Its reed-stops (hautboy, clarinet, &amp;c.) are supposed to be unrivalled. In Newcourt's time the church was taken notice of as &quot;remarkable for possessing an exceedingly fine organ, and the playing is thought so beautiful, that large congregations are attracted, though some of the parishioners object to the mode of performing divine service.&quot;\n\nOn the north side of the church, Mr. Godwin mentions, is a large apartment known as &quot;St. Stephen's Chapel.&quot; This building evidently formed a somewhat important part of the old church, and was probably appropriated to the votaries of the saint whose name it bears.\n\nBetween the exterior and the interior of the church there is little harmony. &quot;For example,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;the columns which form the south aisle face, in some instances, the centre of the large windows which occur in the external wall of the church, and in others the centre of the piers, indifferently.&quot; This discordance may likely enough have arisen from the fact that when the church was rebuilt, or rather restored, after the Great Fire, the works were done without much attention from Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nSt. Sepulchre's appears to have enjoyed considerable popularity from the earliest period of its history, if one is to judge from the various sums left by well-disposed persons for the support of certain fraternities founded in the church\u2014namely, those of St. Katherine, St. Michael, St. Anne, and Our Lady\u2014and by others, for the maintenance of chantry priests to celebrate masses at stated intervals for the good of their souls. One of the fraternities just named\u2014that of St. Katherine\u2014 originated, according to Stow, in the devotion of some poor persons in the parish, and was in honour of the conception of the Virgin Mary. They met in the church on the day of the Conception, and there had the mass of the day, and offered to the same, and provided a certain chaplain daily to celebrate divine service, and to set up wax lights before the image belonging to the fraternity, on all festival days.\n\nThe most famous of all who have been interred in St. Sepulchre's is Roger Ascham, the author of the &quot;Schoolmaster,&quot; and the instructor of Queen Elizabeth in Greek and Latin. This learned old worthy was born in 1515, near Northallerton, in Yorkshire. He was educated at Cambridge University, and in time rose to be the university orator, being notably zealous in promoting what was then a novelty in England\u2014the study of the Greek language. To divert himself after the fatigue of severe study, he used to devote himself to archery. This drew down upon him the censure of the all-work-and-no-play school; and in defence of himself, Ascham, in 1545, published &quot;Toxophilus,&quot; a treatise on his favourite sport. This book is even yet well worthy of perusal, for its enthusiasm, and for its curious descriptions of the personal appearance and manners of the principal persons whom the author had seen and conversed with. Henry VIII. rewarded him with a pension of \u00a310 per annum, a considerable sum in those days. In 1548, Ascham, on the death of William Grindall, who had been his pupil, was appointed instructor in the learned languages to Lady Elizabeth, afterwards the good Queen Bess. At the end of two years he had some dispute with, or took a disgust at, Lady Elizabeth's attendants, resigned his situation, and returned to his college. Soon after this he was employed as secretary to the English ambassador at the court of Charles V. of Germany, and remained abroad till the death of Edward VI. During his absence he had been appointed Latin secretary to King Edward. Strangely enough, though Queen Mary and her ministers were Papists, and Ascham a Protestant, he was retained in his office of Latin secretary, his pension was increased to \u00a320, and he was allowed to retain his fellowship and his situation as university orator. In 1554 he married a lady of good family, by whom he had a considerable fortune, and of whom, in writing to a friend, he gives, as might perhaps be expected, an excellent character. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, she not only required his services as Latin secretary, but as her instructor in Greek, and he resided at Court during the remainder of his life. He died in consequence of his endeavours to complete a Latin poem which he intended to present to the queen on the New Year's Day of 1569. He breathed his last two days before 1568 ran out, and was interred, according to his own directions, in the most private manner, in St. Sepulchre's Church, his funeral sermon being preached by Dr. Andrew Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's. He was universally lamented; and even the queen herself not only showed great concern, but was pleased to say that she would rather have lost ten thousand pounds than her tutor Ascham, which, from that somewhat closehanded sovereign, was truly an expression of high regard.\n\nAscham, like most men, had his little weaknesses. He had too great a propensity to dice and cock-fighting. Bishop Nicholson would try to convince us that this is an unfounded calumny, but, as it is mentioned by Camden, and other contemporary writers, it seems impossible to deny it. He died, from all accounts, in indifferent circumstances. &quot;Whether,&quot; says Dr. Johnson, referring to this, &quot;Ascham was poor by his own fault, or the fault of others, cannot now be decided; but it is certain that many have been rich with less merit. His philological learning would have gained him honour in any country; and among us it may justly call for that reverence which all nations owe to those who first rouse them from ignorance, and kindle among them the light of literature.&quot; His most valuable work, &quot;The Schoolmaster,&quot; was published by his widow. The nature of this celebrated performance may be gathered from the title: &quot;The Schoolmaster; or a plain and perfite way of teaching children to understand, write, and speak the Latin tongue. \u2026 And commodious also for all such as have forgot the Latin tongue, and would by themselves, without a schoolmaster, in short time, and with small pains, recover a sufficient habilitie to understand, write, and speak Latin: by Roger Ascham, ann. 1570. At London, printed by John Daye, dwelling over Aldersgate,&quot; a printer, by the way, already mentioned by us a few chapters back (see page 208), as having printed several noted works of the sixteenth century.\n\nDr. Johnson remarks that the instruction recommended in &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot; is perhaps the best ever given for the study of languages.\n\nHere also lies buried Captain John Smith, a conspicuous soldier of fortune, whose romantic adventures and daring exploits have rarely been surpassed. He died on the 21st of June, 1631. This valiant captain was born at Willoughby, in the county of Lincoln, and helped by his doings to enliven the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. He had a share in the wars of Hungary in 1602, and in three single combats overcame three Turks, and cut off their heads. For this, and other equally brave deeds, Sigismund, Duke of Transylvania, gave him his picture set in gold, with a pension of three hundred ducats; and allowed him to bear three Turks' heads proper as his shield of arms. He afterwards went to America, where he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Indians. He escaped from them, however, at last, and resumed his brilliant career by hazarding his life in naval engagements with pirates and Spanish men-of-war. The most important act of his life was the share he had in civilising the natives of New England, and reducing that province to obedience to Great Britain. In connection with his tomb in St. Sepulchre's, he is mentioned by Stow, in his &quot;Survey,&quot; as &quot;some time Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New England.&quot;\n\nCertainly the most interesting events of his chequered career were his capture by the Indians, and the saving of his life by the Indian girl Pocahontas, a story of adventure that charms as often as it is told. Bancroft, the historian of the United States, relates how, during the early settlement of Virginia, Smith left the infant colony on an exploring expedition, and not only ascended the river Chickahominy, but struck into the interior. His companions disobeyed his instructions, and being surprised by the Indians, were put to death. Smith preserved his own life by calmness and self-possession. Displaying a pocket-compass, he amused the savages by an explanation of its power, and increased their admiration of his superior genius by imparting to them some vague conceptions of the form of the earth, and the nature of the planetary system. To the Indians, who retained him as their prisoner, his captivity was a more strange event than anything of which the traditions of their tribes preserved the memory. He was allowed to send a letter to the fort at Jamestown, and the savage wonder was increased, for he seemed by some magic to endow the paper with the gift of intelligence. It was evident that their captive was a being of a high order, and then the question arose, Was his nature beneficent, or was he to be dreaded as a dangerous enemy? Their minds were bewildered, and the decision of his fate was referred to the chief Powhatan, and before Powhatan Smith was brought. &quot;The fears of the feeble aborigines,&quot; says Bancroft, &quot;were about to prevail, and his immediate death, already repeatedly threatened and repeatedly delayed, would have been inevitable, but for the timely intercession of Pocahontas, a girl twelve years old, the daughter of Powhatan, whose confiding fondness Smith had easily won, and who firmly clung to his neck, as his head was bowed down to receive the stroke of the tomahawks. His fearlessness, and her entreaties, persuaded the council to spare the agreeable stranger, who could make hatchets for her father, and rattles and strings of beads for herself, the favourite child. The barbarians, whose decision had long been held in suspense by the mysterious awe which Smith had inspired, now resolved to receive him as a friend, and to make him a partner of their councils. They tempted him to join their bands, and lend assistance in an attack upon the white men at Jamestown; and when his decision of character succeeded in changing the current of their thoughts, they dismissed him with mutual promises of friendship and benevolence. Thus the captivity of Smith did itself become a benefit to the colony; for he had not only observed with care the country between the James and the Potomac, and had gained some knowledge of the language and manners of the natives, but he now established a peaceful intercourse between the English and the tribes of Powhatan.&quot;\n\nOn the monument erected to Smith in St. Sepulchre's Church, the following quaint lines were formerly inscribed:\u2014\n\n&quot;Here lies one conquered that hath conquered kings,\nSubdued large territories, and done things\nWhich to the world impossible would seem,\nBut that the truth is held in more esteem.\nShall I report his former service done,\nIn honour of his God, and Christendom?\nHow that he did divide, from pagans three,\nTheir heads and lives, types of his chivalry?\u2014\nFor which great service, in that climate done,\nBrave Sigismundus, King of Hungarion,\nDid give him, as a coat of arms, to wear\nThese conquered heads, got by his sword and spear.\nOr shall I tell of his adventures since\nDone in Virginia, that large continent?\nHow that he subdued kings unto his yoke,\nAnd made those heathens flee, as wind doth smoke;\nAnd made their land, being so large a station,\nAn habitation for our Christian nation,\nWhere God is glorified, their wants supplied;\nWhich else for necessaries, must have died.\nBut what avails his conquests, now he lies\nInterred in earth, a prey to worms and flies?\nOh! may his soul in sweet Elysium sleep,\nUntil the Keeper, that all souls doth keep,\nReturn to judgment; and that after thence\nWith angels he may have his recompense.&quot;\n\nSir Robert Peake, the engraver, also found a last resting-place here. He is known as the master of William Faithorne\u2014the famous English engraver of the seventeenth century\u2014and governor of Basing House for the king during the Civil War under Charles I. He died in 1667. Here also was interred the body of Dr. Bell, grandfather of the originator of a well-known system of education.\n\n&quot;The churchyard of St. Sepulchre's,&quot; we learn from Maitland, &quot;at one time extended so far into the street on the south side of the church, as to render the passage-way dangerously narrow. In 1760 the churchyard was, in consequence, levelled, and thrown open to the public. But this led to much inconvenience, and it was re-enclosed in 1802.&quot;\n\nSarah Malcolm, the murderess, was buried in the churchyard of St. Sepulchre's in 1733. This coldhearted and keen-eyed monster in human form has had her story told by us already. The parishioners seem, on this occasion, to have had no such scruples as had been exhibited by their predecessors a hundred and fifty years previous at the burial of Awfield, a traitor. We shall see presently that in those more remote days they were desirous of having at least respectable company for their deceased relatives and friends in the churchyard.\n\n&quot;For a long period,&quot; says Mr. Godwin (1838), &quot;the church was surrounded by low mean buildings, by which its general appearance was hidden; but these having been cleared away, and the neighbourhood made considerably more open, St. Sepulchre's now forms a somewhat pleasing object, notwithstanding that the tower and a part of the porch are so entirely dissimilar in style to the remainder of the building.&quot; And since Godwin's writing the surroundings of the church have been so improved that perhaps few buildings in the metropolis stand more prominently before the public eye.\n\nIn the glorious roll of martyrs who have suffered at the stake for their religious principles, a vicar of St. Sepulchre's, the Reverend John Rogers, occupies a conspicuous place. He was the first who was burned in the reign of the Bloody Mary. This eminent person had at one time been chaplain to the English merchants at Antwerp, and while residing in that city had aided Tindal and Coverdale in their great work of translating the Bible. He married a German lady of good position, by whom he had a large family, and was enabled, by means of her relations, to reside in peace and safety in Germany. It appeared to be his duty, however, to return to England, and there publicly profess and advocate his religious convictions, even at the risk of death. He crossed the sea; he took his place in the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross; he preached a fearless and animated sermon, reminding his astonished audience of the pure and wholesome doctrine which had been promulgated from that pulpit in the days of the good King Edward, and solemnly warning them against the pestilent idolatry and superstition of these new times. It was his last sermon. He was apprehended, tried, condemned, and burned at Smithfield. We described, when speaking of Smithfield, the manner in which he met his fate.\n\nConnected with the martyrdom of Rogers an odd circumstance is quoted in the &quot;Churches of London.&quot; It is stated that when the bishops had resolved to put to death Joan Bocher, a friend came to Rogers and earnestly entreated his influence that the poor woman's life might be spared, and other means taken to prevent the spread of her heterodox doctrines. Rogers, however, contended that she should be executed; and his friend then begged him to choose some other kind of death, which should be more agreeable to the gentleness and mercy prescribed in the gospel. &quot;No,&quot; replied Rogers, &quot;burning alive is not a cruel death, but easy enough.&quot; His friend hearing these words, expressive of so little regard for the sufferings of a fellow-creature, answered him with great vehemence, at the same time striking Rogers' hand, &quot;Well, it may perhaps so happen that you yourself shall have your hands full of this mild burning.&quot; There is no record of Rogers among the papers belonging to St. Sepulchre's, but this may easily be accounted for by the fact that at the Great Fire of 1666 nearly all the registers and archives were destroyed.\n\nA noteworthy incident in the history of St. Sepulchre's was connected with the execution, in 1585, of Awfield, for &quot;sparcinge abrood certen lewed, sedicious, and traytorous bookes.&quot; &quot;When he was executed,&quot; says Fleetwood, the Recorder, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, July 7th of that year, &quot;his body was brought unto St. Pulcher's to be buryed, but the parishioners would not suffer a traytor's corpse to be laid in the earth where their parents, wives, children, kindred, masters, and old neighbours did rest; and so his carcass was returned to the burial-ground near Tyburn, and there I leave it.&quot;\n\nAnother event in the history of the church is a tale of suicide. On the 10th of April, 1600, a man named William Dorrington threw himself from the roof of the tower, leaving there a prayer for forgiveness.\n\nWe come now to speak of the connection of St. Sepulchre's with the neighbouring prison of Newgate. Being the nearest church to the prison, that connection naturally was intimate. Its clock served to give the time to the hangman when there was an execution in the Old Bailey, and many a poor wretch's last moments must it have regulated.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the altar a board with a list of charitable donations and gifts used to contain the following item:\u2014&quot;1605. Mr. Robert Dowe gave, for ringing the greatest bell in this church on the day the condemned prisoners are executed, and for other services, for ever, concerning such condemned prisoners, for which services the sexton is paid \u00a316s. 8d.\u2014\u00a350.\n\nIt was formerly the practice for the clerk or bellman of St. Sepulchre's to go under Newgate, on the night preceding the execution of a criminal, ring his bell, and repeat the following wholesome advice:\u2014\n\n&quot;All you that in the condemned hold do lie,\nPrepare you, for to-morrow you shall die;\nWatch all, and pray, the hour is drawing near\nThat you before the Almighty must appear;\nExamine well yourselves, in time repent,\nThat you may not to eternal flames be sent.\nAnd when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,\nThe Lord above have mercy on your souls.\nPast twelve o'clock!&quot;\n\nThis practice is explained by a passage in Munday's edition of Stow, in which it is told that a Mr. John Dowe, citizen and merchant taylor of London, gave \u00a350 to the parish church of St. Sepulchre's, under the following conditions:\u2014After the several sessions of London, on the night before the execution of such as were condemned to death, the clerk of the church was to go in the night-time, and also early in the morning, to the window of the prison in which they were lying. He was there to ring &quot;certain tolls with a hand-bell&quot; appointed for the purpose, and was afterwards, in a most Christian manner, to put them in mind of their present condition and approaching end, and to exhort them to be prepared, as they ought to be, to die. When they were in the cart, and brought before the walls of the church, the clerk was to stand there ready with the same bell, and, after certain tolls, rehearse a prayer, desiring all the people there present to pray for the unfortunate criminals. The beadle, also, of Merchant Taylors' Hall was allowed an &quot;honest stipend&quot; to see that this ceremony was regularly performed.\n\nThe affecting admonition\u2014&quot;affectingly good,&quot; Pennant calls it\u2014addressed to the prisoners in Newgate, on the night before execution, ran as follows:\u2014\n\n&quot;You prisoners that are within,\nWho, for wickedness and sin,\n\nafter many mercies shown you, are now appointed to die to-morrow in the forenoon; give ear and understand that, to-morrow morning, the greatest bell of St. Sepulchre's shall toll for you, in form and manner of a passing-bell, as used to be tolled for those that are at the point of death; to the end that all godly people, hearing that bell, and knowing it is for your going to your deaths, may be stirred up heartily to pray to God to bestow his grace and mercy upon you, whilst you live. I beseech you, for Jesus Christ's sake, to keep this night in watching and prayer, to the salvation of your own souls while there is yet time and place for mercy; as knowing to-morrow you must appear before the judgment-seat of your Creator, there to give an account of all things done in this life, and to suffer eternal torments for your sins committed against Him, unless, upon your hearty and unfeigned repentance, you find mercy through the merits, death, and passion of your only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return to Him.&quot;\n\nAnd the following was the admonition to condemned criminals, as they were passing by St. Sepulchre's Church wall to execution:\u2014&quot; All good people, pray heartily unto God for these poor sinners, who are now going to their death, for whom this great bell doth toll.\n\n&quot;You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask mercy of the Lord, for the salvation of your own souls, through the [merits, death, and passion of Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto Him.\n\n&quot;Lord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.\nLord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.&quot;\n\nThe charitable Mr. Dowe, who took such interest in the last moments of the occupants of the condemned cell, was buried in the church of St. Botolph, Aldgate.\n\nAnother curious custom observed at St. Sepulchre's was the presentation of a nosegay to every criminal on his way to execution at Tyburn. No doubt the practice had its origin in some kindly feeling for the poor unfortunates who were so soon to bid farewell to all the beauties of earth. One of the last who received a nosegay from the steps of St. Sepulchre's was &quot;Sixteen-string Jack,&quot; alias John Rann, who was hanged, in 1774, for robbing the Rev. Dr. Bell of his watch and eighteen pence in money, in Gunnersbury Lane, on the road to Brentford. Sixteen-string Jack wore the flowers in his button-hole as he rode dolefully to the gallows. This was witnessed by John Thomas Smith, who thus describes the scene in his admirable anecdotebook, &quot;Nollekens and his Times:&quot;\u2014&quot; I remember well, when I was in my eighth year, Mr. Nollekens calling at my father's house, in Great Portland Street, and taking us to Oxford Street, to see the notorious Jack Rann, commonly called Sixteenstring Jack, go to Tyburn to be hanged. \u2026 The criminal was dressed in a pea-green coat, with an immense nosegay in the button-hole, which had been presented to him at St. Sepulchre's steps; and his nankeen small-clothes, we were told, were tied at each knee with sixteen strings. After he had passed, and Mr. Nollekens was leading me home by the hand, I recollect his stooping down to me and observing, in a low tone of voice, 'Tom, now, my little man, if my father-in-law, Mr. Justice Welch, had been high constable, we could have walked by the side of the cart all the way to Tyburn.'&quot;\n\nWhen criminals were conveyed from Newgate to Tyburn, the cart passed up Giltspur Street, and through Smithfield, to Cow Lane. Skinner Street had not then been built, and the Crooked Lane which turned down by St. Sepulchre's, as well as Ozier Lane, did not afford sufficient width to admit of the cavalcade passing by either of them, with convenience, to Holborn Hill, or &quot;the Heavy Hill,&quot; as it used to be called. The procession seems at no time to have had much of the solemn element about it. &quot;The heroes of the day were often,&quot; says a popular writer, &quot;on good terms with the mob, and jokes were exchanged between the men who were going to be hanged and the men who deserved to be.&quot;\n\n&quot;On St. Paul's Day,&quot; says Mr. Timbs (1868), &quot;service is performed in St. Sepulchre's, in accordance with the will of Mr. Paul Jervis, who, in 1717, devised certain land in trust that a sermon should be preached in the church upon every Paul's Day upon the excellence of the liturgy o the Church of England; the preacher to receive 40s. for such sermon. Various sums are also bequeathed to the curate, the clerk, the treasurer, and masters of the parochial schools. To the poor of the parish he bequeathed 20s. a-piece to ten of the poorest householders within that part of the parish of St. Sepulchre commonly called Smithfield quarter, \u00a34 to the treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and 6s. 8d. yearly to the clerk, who shall attend to receive the same. The residue of the yearly rents and profits is to be distributed unto and amongst such poor people of the parish of St. Sepulchre's, London, who shall attend the service and sermon. At the close of the service the vestry-clerk reads aloud an extract from the will, and then proceeds to the distribution of the money. In the evening the vicar, churchwardens, and common councilmen of the precinct dine together.&quot;\n\nIn 1749, a Mr. Drinkwater made a praiseworthy bequest. He left the parish of St. Sepulchre \u00a3500 to be lent in sums of \u00a325 to industrious young tradesmen. No interest was to be charged, and the money was to be lent for four years.\n\nNext to St. Sepulchre's, on Snow Hill, used to stand the famous old inn of the &quot;Saracen's Head.&quot; It was only swept away within the last few years by the ruthless army of City improvers: a view of it in course of demolition was given on page 439. It was one of the oldest of the London inns which bore the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; for a sign. One of Dick Tarlton's jests makes mention of the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; without Newgate, and Stow, describing this neighbourhood, speaks particularly of &quot;a fair large inn for receipt of travellers&quot; that &quot;hath to sign the 'Saracen's Head.'&quot; The courtyard had, to the last, many of the characteristics of an old English inn; there were galleries all round leading to the bedrooms, and a spacious gateway through which the dusty mail-coaches used to rumble, the tired passengers creeping forth &quot;thanking their stars in having escaped the highwaymen and the holes and sloughs of the road.&quot; Into that courtyard how many have come on their first arrival in London with hearts beating high with hope, some of whom have risen to be aldermen and sit in state as lord mayor, whilst others have gone the way of the idle apprentice and come to a sad end at Tyburn! It was at this inn that Nicholas Nickleby and his uncle waited upon the Yorkshire schoolmaster Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall. Mr. Dickens describes the tavern as it existed in the last days of mail-coaching, when it was a most important place for arrivals and departures in London:\u2014\n\n&quot;Next to the jail, and by consequence near to Smithfield also, and the Compter and the bustle and noise of the City, and just on that particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastwards seriously think of falling down on purpose, and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westwards not unfrequently fall by accident, is the coach-yard of the 'Saracen's Head' inn, its portals guarded by two Saracen's heads and shoulders, which it was once the pride and glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night, but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity, possibly because this species of humour is now confined to St. James's parish, where doorknockers are preferred as being more portable, and bell-wires esteemed as convenient tooth-picks. Whether this be the reason or not, there they are, frowning upon you from each side of the gateway; and the inn itself, garnished with another Saracen's head, frowns upon you from the top of the yard; while from the door of the hind-boot of all the red coaches that are standing therein, there glares a small Saracen's head with a twin expression to the large Saracen's head below, so that the general appearance of the pile is of the Saracenic order.&quot;\n\nTo explain the use of the Saracen's head as an inn sign various reasons have been given. &quot;When our countrymen,&quot; says Selden, &quot;came home from fighting with the Saracens and were beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible faces (as you still see the 'Saracen's Head' is), when in truth they were like other men. But this they did to save their own credit.&quot; Or the sign may have been adopted by those who had visited the Holy Land either as pilgrims or to fight the Saracens. Others, again, hold that it was first set up in compliment to the mother of Thomas \u00e0 Becket, who was the daughter of a Saracen. However this may be, it is certain that the use of the sign in former days was very general.\n\nRunning past the east end of St. Sepulchre's, from Newgate into West Smithfield, is Giltspur Street, anciently called Knightriders Street. This interesting thoroughfare derives its name from the knights with their gilt spurs having been accustomed to ride this way to the jousts and tournaments which in days of old were held in Smithfield.\n\nIn this street was Giltspur Street Compter, a debtors' prison and house of correction appertaining to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex. It stood over against St. Sepulchre's Church, and was removed hither from the east side of Wood Street, Cheapside, in 1791. At the time of its removal it was used as a place of imprisonment for debtors, but the yearly increasing demands upon the contracted space caused that department to be given up, and City debtors were sent to Whitecross Street. The architect was Dance, to whom we are also indebted for the grim pile of Newgate. The Compter was a dirty and appropriately convictlooking edifice. It was pulled down in 1855. Mr. Hepworth Dixon gave an interesting account of this City House of Correction, not long before its demolition, in his &quot;London Prisons&quot; (1850). &quot;Entering,&quot; he says, &quot;at the door facing St. Sepulchre's, the visitor suddenly finds himself in a low dark passage, leading into the offices of the gaol, and branching off into other passages, darker, closer, more replete with noxious smells, than even those of Newgate. This is the fitting prelude to what follows. The prison, it must be noticed, is divided into two principal divisions, the House of Correction and the Compter. The front in Giltspur Street, and the side nearest to Newgate Street, is called the Compter. In its wards are placed detenues of various kinds\u2014remands, committals from the police-courts, and generally persons waiting for trial, and consequently still unconvicted. The other department, the House of Correction, occupies the back portion of the premises, abutting on Christ's Hospital. Curious it is to consider how thin a wall divides these widely-separate worlds! And sorrowful it is to think what a difference of destiny awaits the children\u2014destiny inexorable, though often unearned in either case\u2014who, on the one side of it or the other, receive an eleemosynary education! The collegian and the criminal! Who shall say how much mere accident\u2014 circumstances over which the child has little power \u2014determines to a life of usefulness or mischief? From the yards of Giltspur Street prison almost the only objects visible, outside of the gaol itself, are the towers of Christ's Hospital; the only sounds audible, the shouts of the scholars at their play. The balls of the hospital boys often fall within the yards of the prison. Whether these sights and sounds ever cause the criminal to pause and reflect upon the courses of his life, we will not say, but the stranger visiting the place will be very apt to think for him. \u2026\n\n&quot;In the department of the prison called the House of Correction, minor offenders within the City of London are imprisoned. No transports are sent hither, nor is any person whose sentence is above three years in length.&quot; This able writer then goes on to tell of the many crying evils connected with the institution\u2014the want of air, the over-crowded state of the rooms, the absence of proper cellular accommodation, and the vicious intercourse carried on amongst the prisoners. The entire gaol, when he wrote, only contained thirty-six separate sleeping-rooms. Now by the highest prison calculation\u2014and this, be it noted, proceeds on the assumption that three persons can sleep in small, miserable, unventilated cells, which are built for only one, and are too confined for that, being only about one-half the size of the model cell for one at Pentonville\u2014it was only capable of accommodating 203 prisoners, yet by the returns issued at Michaelmas, 1850, it contained 246!\n\nA large section of the prison used to be devoted to female delinquents, but lately it was almost entirely given up to male offenders.\n\n&quot;The House of Correction, and the Compter portion of the establishment,&quot; says Mr. Dixon, &quot;are kept quite distinct, but it would be difficult to award the palm of empire in their respective facilities for demoralisation. We think the Compter rather the worse of the two. You are shown into a room, about the size of an apartment in an ordinary dwelling-house, which will be found crowded with from thirty to forty persons, young and old, and in their ordinary costume; the low thief in his filth and rags, and the member of the swell-mob with his bright buttons, flash finery, and false jewels. Here you notice the boy who has just been guilty of his first offence, and committed for trial, learning with a greedy mind a thousand criminal arts, and listening with the precocious instinct of guilty passions to stories and conversations the most depraved and disgusting. You regard him with a mixture of pity and loathing, for he knows that the eyes of his peers are upon him, and he stares at you with a familiar impudence, and exhibits a devil-may-care countenance, such as is only to be met with in the juvenile offender. Here, too, may be seen the young clerk, taken up on suspicion\u2014perhaps innocent\u2014who avoids you with a shy look of pain and uneasiness: what a hell must this prison be to him! How frightful it is to think of a person really untainted with crime, compelled to herd for ten or twenty days with these abandoned wretches!\n\n&quot;On the other, the House of Correction side of the gaol, similar rooms will be found, full of prisoners communicating with each other, laughing and shouting without hindrance. All this is so little in accordance with existing notions of prison discipline, that one is continually fancying these disgraceful scenes cannot be in the capital of England, and in the year of grace 1850. Very few of the prisoners attend school or receive any instruction; neither is any kind of employment afforded them, except oakum-picking, and the still more disgusting labour of the treadmill. When at work, an officer is in attendance to prevent disorderly conduct; but his presence is of no avail as a protection to the less depraved. Conversation still goes on; and every facility is afforded for making acquaintances, and for mutual contamination.&quot;\n\nAfter having long been branded by intelligent inspectors as a disgrace to the metropolis, Giltspur Street Compter was condemned, closed in 1854, and subsequently taken down.\n\nNearly opposite what used to be the site of the Compter, and adjoining Cock Lane, is the spot called Pie Corner, near which terminated the Great Fire of 1666. The fire commenced at Pudding Lane, it will be remembered, so it was singularly appropriate that it should terminate at Pie Corner. Under the date of 4th September, 1666, Pepys, in his &quot;Diary,&quot; records that &quot;W. Hewer this day went to see how his mother did, and comes home late, telling us how he hath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in Pye Corner being burned; so that the fire is got so far that way.&quot; The figure of a fat naked boy stands over a public house at the corner of the lane; it used to have the following warning inscription attached:\u2014 &quot;This boy is in memory put up of the late fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony, 1666.&quot; According to Stow, Pie Corner derived its name from the sign of a well-frequented hostelry, which anciently stood on the spot. Strype makes honourable mention of Pie Corner, as &quot;noted chiefly for cooks' shops and pigs dressed there during Bartholomew Fair.&quot; Our old writers have many references\u2014and not all, by the way, in the best taste\u2014to its cookstalls and dressed pork. Shadwell, for instance, in the Woman Captain (1680) speaks of &quot;meat dressed at Pie Corner by greasy scullions;&quot; and Ben Jonson writes in the Alchemist (1612)\u2014\n\n&quot;I shall put you in mind, sir, at Pie Corner,\nTaking your meal of steam in from cooks' stalls.&quot;\n\nAnd in &quot;The Great Boobee&quot; (&quot;Roxburgh Ballads&quot;):\n\n&quot;Next day I through Pie Corner passed;\nThe roast meat on the stall\nInvited me to take a taste;\nMy money was but small.&quot;\n\nBut Pie Corner seems to have been noted for more than eatables. A ballad from Tom D'Urfey's &quot;Pills to Purge Melancholy,&quot; describing Bartholomew Fair, eleven years before the Fire of London, says:\u2014\n\n&quot;At Pie-Corner end, mark well my good friend,\n'Tis a very fine dirty place;\nWhere there's more arrows and bows. \u2026\nThan was handled at Chivy Chase.&quot;\n\nWe have already given a view of Pie Corner in our chapter on Smithfield, page 361.\n\nHosier Lane, running from Cow Lane to Smithfield, and almost parallel to Cock Lane, is described by &quot;R. B.,&quot; in Strype, as a place not over-well built or inhabited. The houses were all old timber erections. Some of these\u2014those standing at the south corner of the lane\u2014were in the beginning of this century depicted by Mr. J. T. Smith, in his &quot;Ancient Topography of London.&quot; He describes them as probably of the reign of James I. The rooms were small, with low, unornamented ceilings; the timber, oak, profusely used; the gables were plain, and the walls lath and plaster. They were taken down in 1809.\n\nIn the corner house, in Mr. Smith's time, there was a barber whose name was Catchpole; at least, so it was written over the door. He was rather an odd fellow, and possessed, according to his own account, a famous relic of antiquity. He would gravely show his customers a short-bladed instrument, as the identical dagger with which Walworth killed Wat Tyler.\n\nHosier Lane, like Pie Corner, used to be a great resort during the time of Bartholomew Fair, &quot;all the houses,&quot; it is said in Strype, &quot;generally being made public for tippling.&quot;\n\nWe return now from our excursion to the north of St. Sepulchre's, and continue our rambles to the west, and before speaking of what is, let us refer to what has been.\n\nTurnagain Lane is not far from this. &quot;Near unto this Seacoal Lane,&quot; remarks Stow, &quot;in the turning towards Holborn Conduit, is Turnagain Lane, or rather, as in a record of the 5th of Edward III., Windagain Lane, for that it goeth down west to Fleet Dyke, from whence men must turn again the same way they came, but there it stopped.&quot; There used to be a proverb, &quot;He must take him a house in Turnagain Lane.&quot;\n\nA conduit formerly stood on Snow Hill, a little below the church. It is described as a building with four equal sides, ornamented with four columns and pediment, surmounted by a pyramid, on which stood a lamb\u2014a rebus on the name of Lamb, from whose conduit in Red Lion Street the water came. There had been a conduit there, however, before Lamb's day, which was towards the close of the sixteenth century.\n\nAt No. 37, King Street, Snow Hill, there used to be a ladies' charity school, which was established in 1702, and remained in the parish 145 years. Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale were subscribers to this school, and Johnson drew from it his story of Betty Broom, in &quot;The Idler.&quot; The world of domestic service, in Betty's days, seems to have been pretty much as now. Betty was a poor girl, bred in the country at a charity-school, maintained by the contributions of wealthy neighbours. The patronesses visited the school from time to time, to see how the pupils got on, and everything went well, till &quot;at last, the chief of the subscribers having passed a winter in London, came down full of an opinion new and strange to the whole country. She held it little less than criminal to teach poor girls to read and write. They who are born to poverty, she said, are born to ignorance, and will work the harder the less they know. She told her friends that London was in confusion by the insolence of servants; that scarcely a girl could be got for all-work, since education had made such numbers of fine ladies, that nobody would now accept a lower title than that of a waiting-maid, or something that might qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles, and to sit at work in the parlour window. But she was resolved, for her part, to spoil no more girls. Those who were to live by their hands should neither read nor write out of her pocket. The world was bad enough already, and she would have no part in making it worse.\n\n&quot;She was for a long time warmly opposed; but she persevered in her notions, and withdrew her subscription. Few listen, without a desire of conviction, to those who advise them to spare their money. Her example and her arguments gained ground daily; and in less than a year the whole parish was convinced that the nation would be ruined if the children of the poor were taught to read and write.&quot; So the school was dissolved, and Betty with the rest was turned adrift into the wide and cold world; and her adventures there any one may read in &quot;The Idler&quot; for himself.\n\nThere is an entry in the school minutes of 1763, to the effect that the ladies of the committee censured the schoolmistress for listening to the story of the Cock Lane ghost, and &quot;desired her to keep her belief in the article to herself.&quot;\n\nSkinner Street\u2014now one of the names of the past\u2014which ran by the south side of St. Sepulchre's, and formed the connecting link between Newgate Street and Holborn, received its name from Alderman Skinner, through whose exertions, about 1802, it was principally built. The following account of Skinner Street is from the picturesque pen of Mr. William Harvey (&quot;Aleph&quot;), whose long familiarity with the places he describes renders doubly valuable his many contributions to the history of London scenes and people:\u2014&quot;As a building speculation,&quot; he says, writing in 1863, &quot;it was a failure. When the buildings were ready for occupation, tall and substantial as they really were, the high rents frightened intending shopkeepers. Tenants were not to be had; and in order to get over the money difficulty, a lottery, sanctioned by Parliament, was commenced. Lotteries were then common tricks of finance, and nobody wondered at the new venture; but even the most desperate fortune-hunters were slow to invest their capital, and the tickets hung sadly on hand. The day for the drawing was postponed several times, and when it came, there was little or no excitement on the subject, and whoever rejoiced in becoming a house-owner on such easy terms, the original projectors and builders were understood to have suffered considerably. The winners found the property in a very unfinished condition. Few of the dwellings were habitable, and as funds were often wanting, a majority of the houses remained empty, and the shops unopened. After two or three years things began to improve; the vast many-storeyed house which then covered the site of Commercial Place was converted into a warehousing dep\u00f4t; a capital house opposite the 'Saracen's Head' was taken by a hosier of the name of Theobald, who, opening his shop with the determination of selling the best hosiery, and nothing else, was able to convince the citizens that his hose was first-rate, and, desiring only a living profit, succeeded, after thirty years of unwearied industry, in accumulating a large fortune. Theobald was possessed of literary tastes, and at the sale of Sir Walter Scott's manuscripts was a liberal purchaser. He also collected a library of exceedingly choice books, and when aristocratic customers purchased stockings of him, was soon able to interest them in matters of far higher interest\u2026\n\n&quot;The most remarkable shop\u2014but it was on the left-hand side, at a corner house\u2014was that established for the sale of children's books. It boasted an immense extent of window-front, extending from the entrance into Snow Hill, and towards Fleet Market. Many a time have I lingered with loving eyes over those fascinating story-books, so rich in gaily-coloured prints; such careful editions of the marvellous old histories, 'Puss in Boots,' 'Cock Robin,' 'Cinderella,' and the like. Fortunately the front was kept low, so as exactly to suit the capacity of a childish admirer. . . . . But Skinner Street did not prosper much, and never could compete with even the dullest portions of Holborn. I have spoken of some reputable shops; but you know the proverb, 'One swallow will not make a summer,' and it was a declining neighbourhood almost before it could be called new. In 1810 the commercial dep\u00f4t, which had been erected at a cost of \u00a325,000, and was the chief prize in the lottery, was destroyed by fire, never to be rebuilt\u2014a heavy blow and discouragement to Skinner Street, from which it never rallied. Perhaps the periodical hanging-days exercised an unfavourable influence, collecting, as they frequently did, all the thieves and vagabonds of London. I never sympathised with Pepys or Charles Fox in their passion for public executions, and made it a point to avoid those ghastly sights; but early of a Monday morning, when I had just reached the end of Giltspur Street, a miserable wretch had just been turned off from the platform of the debtors' door, and I was made the unwilling witness of his last struggles. That scene haunted me for months, and I often used to ask myself, 'Who that could help it would live in Skinner Street?' The next unpropitious event in these parts was the unexpected closing of the child's library. What could it mean? Such a well-to-do establishment shut up? Yes, the whole army of shutters looked blankly on the inquirer, and forbade even a single glance at 'Sinbad' or 'Robinson Crusoe.' It would soon be re-opened, we naturally thought; but the shutters never came down again. The whole house was deserted; not even a messenger in bankruptcy, or an ancient Charley, was found to regard the playful double knocks of the neighbouring juveniles. Gradually the glass of all the windows got broken in, a heavy cloud of black dust, solidifying into inches thick, gathered on sills and doors and brickwork, till the whole frontage grew as gloomy as Giant Despair's Castle. Not long after, the adjoining houses shared the same fate, and they remained from year to year without the slightest sign of life\u2014absolute scarecrows, darkening with their uncomfortable shadows the busy streets. Within half a mile, in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, there are (1863) seven houses in a similar predicament\u2014 window-glass demolished, doors cracked from top to bottom, spiders' webs hanging from every projecting sill or parapet. What can it mean? The loss in the article of rents alone must be over \u00a31,000 annually. If the real owners are at feud with imaginary owners, surely the property might be rendered valuable, and the proceeds invested. Even the lawyers can derive no profit from such hopeless abandonment. I am told the whole mischief arose out of a Chancery suit. Can it be the famous 'Jarndyce v. Jarndyce' case? And have all the heirs starved each other out? If so, what hinders our lady the Queen from taking possession? Any change would be an improvement, for these dead houses make the streets they cumber as dispiriting and comfortless as graveyards. Busy fancy will sometimes people them, and fill the dreary rooms with strange guests. Do the victims of guilt congregate in these dark dens? Do wretches 'unfriended by the world or the world's law,' seek refuge in these deserted nooks, mourning in the silence of despair over their former lives, and anticipating the future in unappeasable agony? Such things have been\u2014the silence and desolation of these doomed dwellings make them the more suitable for such tenants.&quot;\n\nA street is nothing without a mystery, so a mystery let these old tumble-down houses remain, whilst we go on to tell that, in front of No. 58, the sailor Cashman was hung in 1817, as we have already mentioned, for plundering a gunsmith's shop there. William Godwin, the author of &quot;Caleb Williams,&quot; kept a bookseller's shop for several years in Skinner Street, at No. 41, and published school-books in the name of Edward Baldwin. On the wall there was a stone carving of \u00c6sop reciting one of his fables to children.\n\nThe most noteworthy event of the life of Godwin was his marriage with the celebrated Mary Wollstonecraft, authoress of a &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women,&quot; whose congenial mind, in politics and morals, he ardently admired. Godwin's account of the way in which they got on together is worth reading:\u2014&quot;Ours,&quot; he writes, &quot;was not an idle happiness, a paradise of selfish and transitory pleasures. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to mention, that influenced by ideas I had long entertained, I engaged an apartment about twenty doors from our house, in the Polygon, Somers Town, which I designed for the purpose of my study and literary occupations. Trifles, however, will be interesting to some readers, when they relate to the last period of the life of such a person as Mary. I will add, therefore, that we were both of us of opinion, that it was possible for two persons to be too uniformly in each other's society. Influenced by that opinion, it was my practice to repair to the apartment I have mentioned as soon as I rose, and frequently not to make my appearance in the Polygon till the hour of dinner. We agreed in condemning the notion, prevalent in many situations in life, that a man and his wife cannot visit in mixed society but in company with each other, and we rather sought occasions of deviating from than of complying with this rule. By this means, though, for the most part, we spent the latter half of each day in one another's society, yet we were in no danger of satiety. We seemed to combine, in a considerable degree, the novelty and lively sensation of a visit with the more delicious and heartfelt pleasure of a domestic life.&quot;\n\nThis philosophic union, to Godwin's inexpressible affliction, did not last more than eighteen months, at the end of which time Mrs. Godwin died, leaving an only daughter, who in the course of time became the second wife of the poet Shelley, and was the author of the wild and extraordinary tale of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116<\/a>"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Jelltex","count_faves":"2","count_comments":"0","can_comment":0,"permissions":{"permcomment":1},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":62,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":148,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":197,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":308,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":394,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":492,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5611\/15162536163_3167603025_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":630,"pathalias":"jelltecks"},{"id":"15788181192","owner":"16105638@N00","secret":"2943bc90b0","server":"7563","farm":8,"title":"St Sepulchre Without Newgate, City of London","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"With the rain falling harder, it was a bit of a route march to Holborn and my next church, the stunning St Sepulchre, which was also open.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSt Sepulchre-without-Newgate, also known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Holborn), is an Anglican church in the City of London. It is located on Holborn Viaduct, almost opposite the Old Bailey. In medieval times it stood just outside (&quot;without&quot;) the now-demolished old city wall, near the Newgate. It has been a living of St John's College, Oxford, since 1622.\n\nThe original Saxon church on the site was dedicated to St Edmund the King and Martyr. During the Crusades in the 12th century the church was renamed St Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, in reference to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The name eventually became contracted to St Sepulchre.\n\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the City. It was completely rebuilt in the 15th century but was gutted by the Great Fire of London in 1666,[1] which left only the outer walls, the tower and the porch standing[2] -. Modified in the 18th century, the church underwent extensive restoration in 1878. It narrowly avoided destruction in the Second World War, although the 18th-century watch-house in its churchyard (erected to deter grave-robbers) was completely destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a coffered ceiling[3] installed in 1834. The Vicars' old residence has recently been renovated into a modern living quarter.\n\nDuring the reign of Mary I in 1555, St Sepulchre's vicar, John Rogers, was burned as a heretic.\n\nSt Sepulchre is named in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons as the &quot;bells of Old Bailey&quot;. Traditionally, the great bell would be rung to mark the execution of a prisoner at the nearby gallows at Newgate. The clerk of St Sepulchre's was also responsible for ringing a handbell outside the condemned man's cell in Newgate Prison to inform him of his impending execution. This handbell, known as the Execution Bell, now resides in a glass case to the south of the nave.\n\nThe church has been the official musicians' church for many years and is associated with many famous musicians. Its north aisle (formerly a chapel dedicated to Stephen Harding) is dedicated as the Musicians' Chapel, with four windows commemorating John Ireland, the singer Dame Nellie Melba, Walter Carroll and the conductor Sir Henry Wood respectively.[4] Wood, who &quot;at the age of fourteen, learned to play the organ&quot; at this church [1] and later became its organist, also has his ashes buried in this church.\n\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.[5] The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the City of London Rifles (the 6th Battalion London Regiment). The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate<\/a>\n\nThe Early History of St. Sepulchre's\u2014Its Destruction in 1666\u2014The Exterior and Interior\u2014The Early Popularity of the Church\u2014Interments here\u2014Roger Ascham, the Author of the &quot;Schoolmaster&quot;\u2014Captain John Smith, and his Romantic Adventures\u2014Saved by an Indian Girl\u2014 St. Sepulchre's Churchyard\u2014Accommodation for a Murderess\u2014The Martyr Rogers\u2014An Odd Circumstance\u2014Good Company for the Dead\u2014A Leap from the Tower\u2014A Warning Bell and a Last Admonition\u2014Nosegays for the Condemned\u2014The Route to the Gallows-tree\u2014 The Deeds of the Charitable\u2014The &quot;Saracen's Head&quot;\u2014Description by Dickens\u2014Giltspur Street\u2014Giltspur Street Compter\u2014A Disreputable Condition\u2014Pie Corner\u2014Hosier Lane\u2014A Spurious Relic\u2014The Conduit on Snow Hill\u2014A Ladies' Charity School\u2014Turnagain Lane\u2014Poor Betty!\u2014A Schoolmistress Censured\u2014Skinner Street\u2014Unpropitious Fortune\u2014William Godwin\u2014An Original Married Life.\n\nMany interesting associations\u2014Principally, however, connected with the annals of crime and the execution of the laws of England\u2014belong to the Church of St. Sepulchre, or St. 'Pulchre. This sacred edifice\u2014anciently known as St. Sepulchre's in the Bailey, or by Chamberlain Gate (now Newgate)\u2014stands at the eastern end of the slight acclivity of Snow Hill, and between Smithfield and the Old Bailey. The genuine materials for its early history are scanty enough. It was probably founded about the commencement of the twelfth century, but of the exact date and circumstances of its origin there is no record whatever. Its name is derived from the Holy Sepulchre of our Saviour at Jerusalem, to the memory of which it was first dedicated.\n\nThe earliest authentic notice of the church, according to Maitland, is of the year 1178, at which date it was given by Roger, Bishop of Sarum, to the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew. These held the right of advowson until the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII., and from that time until 1610 it remained in the hands of the Crown. James I., however, then granted &quot;the rectory and its appurtenances, with the advowson of the vicarage,&quot; to Francis Phillips and others. The next stage in its history is that the rectory was purchased by the parishioners, to be held in fee-farm of the Crown, and the advowson was obtained by the President and Fellows of St. John the Baptist College, at Oxford.\n\nThe church was rebuilt about the middle of the fifteenth century, when one of the Popham family, who had been Chancellor of Normandy and Treasurer of the King's Household, with distinguished liberality erected a handsome chapel on the south side of the choir, and the very beautiful porch still remaining at the south-west corner of the building. &quot;His image,&quot; Stow says, &quot;fair graven in stone, was fixed over the said porch.&quot;\n\nThe dreadful fire of 1666 almost destroyed St. Sepulchre's, but the parishioners set energetically to work, and it was &quot;rebuilt and beautified both within and without.&quot; The general reparation was under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren, and nothing but the walls of the old building, and these not entirely, were suffered to remain. The work was done rapidly, and the whole was completed within four years.\n\n&quot;The tower,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;retained its original aspect, and the body of the church, after its restoration, presented a series of windows between buttresses, with pointed heads filled with tracery, crowned by a string-course and battlements. In this form it remained till the year 1790, when it appears the whole fabric was found to be in a state of great decay, and it was resolved to repair it throughout. Accordingly the walls of the church were cased with Portland stone, and all the windows were taken out and replaced by others with plain semi-circular heads, as now seen\u2014certainly agreeing but badly with the tower and porch of the building, but according with the then prevailing spirit of economy. The battlements, too, were taken down, and a plain stone parapet was substituted, so that at this time (with the exception of the roof, which was wagon-headed, and presented on the outside an unsightly swell, visible above the parapet) the church assumed its present appearance.&quot; The ungainly roof was removed, and an entirely new one erected, about 1836.\n\nAt each corner of the tower\u2014&quot;one of the most ancient,&quot; says the author of &quot;Londinium Redivivum,&quot; &quot;in the outline of the circuit of London&quot; \u2014there are spires, and on the spires there are weathercocks. These have been made use of by Howell to point a moral: &quot;Unreasonable people,&quot; says he, &quot;are as hard to reconcile as the vanes of St. Sepulchre's tower, which never look all four upon one point of the heavens.&quot; Nothing can be said with certainty as to the date of the tower, but it is not without the bounds of probability that it formed part of the original building. The belfry is reached by a small winding staircase in the south-west angle, and a similar staircase in an opposite angle leads to the summit. The spires at the corners, and some of the tower windows, have very recently undergone several alterations, which have added much to the picturesqueness and beauty of the church.\n\nThe chief entrance to St. Sepulchre's is by a porch of singular beauty, projecting from the south side of the tower, at the western end of the church. The groining of the ceiling of this porch, it has been pointed out, takes an almost unique form; the ribs are carved in bold relief, and the bosses at the intersections represent angels' heads, shields, roses, &amp;c., in great variety.\n\nComing now to the interior of the church, we find it divided into three aisles, by two ranges of Tuscan columns. The aisles are of unequal widths, that in the centre being the widest, that to the south the narrowest. Semi-circular arches connect the columns on either side, springing directly from their capitals, without the interposition of an entablature, and support a large dental cornice, extending round the church. The ceiling of the middle aisle is divided into seven compartments, by horizontal bands, the middle compartment being formed into a small dome.\n\nThe aisles have groined ceilings, ornamented at the angles with doves, &amp;c., and beneath every division of the groining are small windows, to admit light to the galleries. Over each of the aisles there is a gallery, very clumsily introduced, which dates from the time when the church was built by Wren, and extends the whole length, excepting at the chancel. The front of the gallery, which is of oak, is described by Mr. Godwin as carved into scrolls, branches, &amp;c., in the centre panel, on either side, with the initials &quot;C. R.,&quot; enriched with carvings of laurel, which have, however, he says, &quot;but little merit.&quot;\n\nAt the east end of the church there are three semicircular-headed windows. Beneath the centre one is a large Corinthian altar-piece of oak, displaying columns, entablatures, &amp;c., elaborately carved and gilded.\n\nThe length of the church, exclusive of the ambulatory, is said to be 126 feet, the breadth 68 feet, and the height of the tower 140 feet.\n\nA singularly ugly sounding-board, extending over the preacher, used to stand at the back of the pulpit, at the east end of the church. It was in the shape of a large parabolic reflector, about twelve feet in diameter, and was composed of ribs of mahogany.\n\nAt the west end of the church there is a large organ, said to be the oldest and one of the finest in London. It was built in 1677, and has been greatly enlarged. Its reed-stops (hautboy, clarinet, &amp;c.) are supposed to be unrivalled. In Newcourt's time the church was taken notice of as &quot;remarkable for possessing an exceedingly fine organ, and the playing is thought so beautiful, that large congregations are attracted, though some of the parishioners object to the mode of performing divine service.&quot;\n\nOn the north side of the church, Mr. Godwin mentions, is a large apartment known as &quot;St. Stephen's Chapel.&quot; This building evidently formed a somewhat important part of the old church, and was probably appropriated to the votaries of the saint whose name it bears.\n\nBetween the exterior and the interior of the church there is little harmony. &quot;For example,&quot; says Mr. Godwin, &quot;the columns which form the south aisle face, in some instances, the centre of the large windows which occur in the external wall of the church, and in others the centre of the piers, indifferently.&quot; This discordance may likely enough have arisen from the fact that when the church was rebuilt, or rather restored, after the Great Fire, the works were done without much attention from Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nSt. Sepulchre's appears to have enjoyed considerable popularity from the earliest period of its history, if one is to judge from the various sums left by well-disposed persons for the support of certain fraternities founded in the church\u2014namely, those of St. Katherine, St. Michael, St. Anne, and Our Lady\u2014and by others, for the maintenance of chantry priests to celebrate masses at stated intervals for the good of their souls. One of the fraternities just named\u2014that of St. Katherine\u2014 originated, according to Stow, in the devotion of some poor persons in the parish, and was in honour of the conception of the Virgin Mary. They met in the church on the day of the Conception, and there had the mass of the day, and offered to the same, and provided a certain chaplain daily to celebrate divine service, and to set up wax lights before the image belonging to the fraternity, on all festival days.\n\nThe most famous of all who have been interred in St. Sepulchre's is Roger Ascham, the author of the &quot;Schoolmaster,&quot; and the instructor of Queen Elizabeth in Greek and Latin. This learned old worthy was born in 1515, near Northallerton, in Yorkshire. He was educated at Cambridge University, and in time rose to be the university orator, being notably zealous in promoting what was then a novelty in England\u2014the study of the Greek language. To divert himself after the fatigue of severe study, he used to devote himself to archery. This drew down upon him the censure of the all-work-and-no-play school; and in defence of himself, Ascham, in 1545, published &quot;Toxophilus,&quot; a treatise on his favourite sport. This book is even yet well worthy of perusal, for its enthusiasm, and for its curious descriptions of the personal appearance and manners of the principal persons whom the author had seen and conversed with. Henry VIII. rewarded him with a pension of \u00a310 per annum, a considerable sum in those days. In 1548, Ascham, on the death of William Grindall, who had been his pupil, was appointed instructor in the learned languages to Lady Elizabeth, afterwards the good Queen Bess. At the end of two years he had some dispute with, or took a disgust at, Lady Elizabeth's attendants, resigned his situation, and returned to his college. Soon after this he was employed as secretary to the English ambassador at the court of Charles V. of Germany, and remained abroad till the death of Edward VI. During his absence he had been appointed Latin secretary to King Edward. Strangely enough, though Queen Mary and her ministers were Papists, and Ascham a Protestant, he was retained in his office of Latin secretary, his pension was increased to \u00a320, and he was allowed to retain his fellowship and his situation as university orator. In 1554 he married a lady of good family, by whom he had a considerable fortune, and of whom, in writing to a friend, he gives, as might perhaps be expected, an excellent character. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, she not only required his services as Latin secretary, but as her instructor in Greek, and he resided at Court during the remainder of his life. He died in consequence of his endeavours to complete a Latin poem which he intended to present to the queen on the New Year's Day of 1569. He breathed his last two days before 1568 ran out, and was interred, according to his own directions, in the most private manner, in St. Sepulchre's Church, his funeral sermon being preached by Dr. Andrew Nowell, Dean of St. Paul's. He was universally lamented; and even the queen herself not only showed great concern, but was pleased to say that she would rather have lost ten thousand pounds than her tutor Ascham, which, from that somewhat closehanded sovereign, was truly an expression of high regard.\n\nAscham, like most men, had his little weaknesses. He had too great a propensity to dice and cock-fighting. Bishop Nicholson would try to convince us that this is an unfounded calumny, but, as it is mentioned by Camden, and other contemporary writers, it seems impossible to deny it. He died, from all accounts, in indifferent circumstances. &quot;Whether,&quot; says Dr. Johnson, referring to this, &quot;Ascham was poor by his own fault, or the fault of others, cannot now be decided; but it is certain that many have been rich with less merit. His philological learning would have gained him honour in any country; and among us it may justly call for that reverence which all nations owe to those who first rouse them from ignorance, and kindle among them the light of literature.&quot; His most valuable work, &quot;The Schoolmaster,&quot; was published by his widow. The nature of this celebrated performance may be gathered from the title: &quot;The Schoolmaster; or a plain and perfite way of teaching children to understand, write, and speak the Latin tongue. \u2026 And commodious also for all such as have forgot the Latin tongue, and would by themselves, without a schoolmaster, in short time, and with small pains, recover a sufficient habilitie to understand, write, and speak Latin: by Roger Ascham, ann. 1570. At London, printed by John Daye, dwelling over Aldersgate,&quot; a printer, by the way, already mentioned by us a few chapters back (see page 208), as having printed several noted works of the sixteenth century.\n\nDr. Johnson remarks that the instruction recommended in &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot; is perhaps the best ever given for the study of languages.\n\nHere also lies buried Captain John Smith, a conspicuous soldier of fortune, whose romantic adventures and daring exploits have rarely been surpassed. He died on the 21st of June, 1631. This valiant captain was born at Willoughby, in the county of Lincoln, and helped by his doings to enliven the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. He had a share in the wars of Hungary in 1602, and in three single combats overcame three Turks, and cut off their heads. For this, and other equally brave deeds, Sigismund, Duke of Transylvania, gave him his picture set in gold, with a pension of three hundred ducats; and allowed him to bear three Turks' heads proper as his shield of arms. He afterwards went to America, where he had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Indians. He escaped from them, however, at last, and resumed his brilliant career by hazarding his life in naval engagements with pirates and Spanish men-of-war. The most important act of his life was the share he had in civilising the natives of New England, and reducing that province to obedience to Great Britain. In connection with his tomb in St. Sepulchre's, he is mentioned by Stow, in his &quot;Survey,&quot; as &quot;some time Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New England.&quot;\n\nCertainly the most interesting events of his chequered career were his capture by the Indians, and the saving of his life by the Indian girl Pocahontas, a story of adventure that charms as often as it is told. Bancroft, the historian of the United States, relates how, during the early settlement of Virginia, Smith left the infant colony on an exploring expedition, and not only ascended the river Chickahominy, but struck into the interior. His companions disobeyed his instructions, and being surprised by the Indians, were put to death. Smith preserved his own life by calmness and self-possession. Displaying a pocket-compass, he amused the savages by an explanation of its power, and increased their admiration of his superior genius by imparting to them some vague conceptions of the form of the earth, and the nature of the planetary system. To the Indians, who retained him as their prisoner, his captivity was a more strange event than anything of which the traditions of their tribes preserved the memory. He was allowed to send a letter to the fort at Jamestown, and the savage wonder was increased, for he seemed by some magic to endow the paper with the gift of intelligence. It was evident that their captive was a being of a high order, and then the question arose, Was his nature beneficent, or was he to be dreaded as a dangerous enemy? Their minds were bewildered, and the decision of his fate was referred to the chief Powhatan, and before Powhatan Smith was brought. &quot;The fears of the feeble aborigines,&quot; says Bancroft, &quot;were about to prevail, and his immediate death, already repeatedly threatened and repeatedly delayed, would have been inevitable, but for the timely intercession of Pocahontas, a girl twelve years old, the daughter of Powhatan, whose confiding fondness Smith had easily won, and who firmly clung to his neck, as his head was bowed down to receive the stroke of the tomahawks. His fearlessness, and her entreaties, persuaded the council to spare the agreeable stranger, who could make hatchets for her father, and rattles and strings of beads for herself, the favourite child. The barbarians, whose decision had long been held in suspense by the mysterious awe which Smith had inspired, now resolved to receive him as a friend, and to make him a partner of their councils. They tempted him to join their bands, and lend assistance in an attack upon the white men at Jamestown; and when his decision of character succeeded in changing the current of their thoughts, they dismissed him with mutual promises of friendship and benevolence. Thus the captivity of Smith did itself become a benefit to the colony; for he had not only observed with care the country between the James and the Potomac, and had gained some knowledge of the language and manners of the natives, but he now established a peaceful intercourse between the English and the tribes of Powhatan.&quot;\n\nOn the monument erected to Smith in St. Sepulchre's Church, the following quaint lines were formerly inscribed:\u2014\n\n&quot;Here lies one conquered that hath conquered kings,\nSubdued large territories, and done things\nWhich to the world impossible would seem,\nBut that the truth is held in more esteem.\nShall I report his former service done,\nIn honour of his God, and Christendom?\nHow that he did divide, from pagans three,\nTheir heads and lives, types of his chivalry?\u2014\nFor which great service, in that climate done,\nBrave Sigismundus, King of Hungarion,\nDid give him, as a coat of arms, to wear\nThese conquered heads, got by his sword and spear.\nOr shall I tell of his adventures since\nDone in Virginia, that large continent?\nHow that he subdued kings unto his yoke,\nAnd made those heathens flee, as wind doth smoke;\nAnd made their land, being so large a station,\nAn habitation for our Christian nation,\nWhere God is glorified, their wants supplied;\nWhich else for necessaries, must have died.\nBut what avails his conquests, now he lies\nInterred in earth, a prey to worms and flies?\nOh! may his soul in sweet Elysium sleep,\nUntil the Keeper, that all souls doth keep,\nReturn to judgment; and that after thence\nWith angels he may have his recompense.&quot;\n\nSir Robert Peake, the engraver, also found a last resting-place here. He is known as the master of William Faithorne\u2014the famous English engraver of the seventeenth century\u2014and governor of Basing House for the king during the Civil War under Charles I. He died in 1667. Here also was interred the body of Dr. Bell, grandfather of the originator of a well-known system of education.\n\n&quot;The churchyard of St. Sepulchre's,&quot; we learn from Maitland, &quot;at one time extended so far into the street on the south side of the church, as to render the passage-way dangerously narrow. In 1760 the churchyard was, in consequence, levelled, and thrown open to the public. But this led to much inconvenience, and it was re-enclosed in 1802.&quot;\n\nSarah Malcolm, the murderess, was buried in the churchyard of St. Sepulchre's in 1733. This coldhearted and keen-eyed monster in human form has had her story told by us already. The parishioners seem, on this occasion, to have had no such scruples as had been exhibited by their predecessors a hundred and fifty years previous at the burial of Awfield, a traitor. We shall see presently that in those more remote days they were desirous of having at least respectable company for their deceased relatives and friends in the churchyard.\n\n&quot;For a long period,&quot; says Mr. Godwin (1838), &quot;the church was surrounded by low mean buildings, by which its general appearance was hidden; but these having been cleared away, and the neighbourhood made considerably more open, St. Sepulchre's now forms a somewhat pleasing object, notwithstanding that the tower and a part of the porch are so entirely dissimilar in style to the remainder of the building.&quot; And since Godwin's writing the surroundings of the church have been so improved that perhaps few buildings in the metropolis stand more prominently before the public eye.\n\nIn the glorious roll of martyrs who have suffered at the stake for their religious principles, a vicar of St. Sepulchre's, the Reverend John Rogers, occupies a conspicuous place. He was the first who was burned in the reign of the Bloody Mary. This eminent person had at one time been chaplain to the English merchants at Antwerp, and while residing in that city had aided Tindal and Coverdale in their great work of translating the Bible. He married a German lady of good position, by whom he had a large family, and was enabled, by means of her relations, to reside in peace and safety in Germany. It appeared to be his duty, however, to return to England, and there publicly profess and advocate his religious convictions, even at the risk of death. He crossed the sea; he took his place in the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross; he preached a fearless and animated sermon, reminding his astonished audience of the pure and wholesome doctrine which had been promulgated from that pulpit in the days of the good King Edward, and solemnly warning them against the pestilent idolatry and superstition of these new times. It was his last sermon. He was apprehended, tried, condemned, and burned at Smithfield. We described, when speaking of Smithfield, the manner in which he met his fate.\n\nConnected with the martyrdom of Rogers an odd circumstance is quoted in the &quot;Churches of London.&quot; It is stated that when the bishops had resolved to put to death Joan Bocher, a friend came to Rogers and earnestly entreated his influence that the poor woman's life might be spared, and other means taken to prevent the spread of her heterodox doctrines. Rogers, however, contended that she should be executed; and his friend then begged him to choose some other kind of death, which should be more agreeable to the gentleness and mercy prescribed in the gospel. &quot;No,&quot; replied Rogers, &quot;burning alive is not a cruel death, but easy enough.&quot; His friend hearing these words, expressive of so little regard for the sufferings of a fellow-creature, answered him with great vehemence, at the same time striking Rogers' hand, &quot;Well, it may perhaps so happen that you yourself shall have your hands full of this mild burning.&quot; There is no record of Rogers among the papers belonging to St. Sepulchre's, but this may easily be accounted for by the fact that at the Great Fire of 1666 nearly all the registers and archives were destroyed.\n\nA noteworthy incident in the history of St. Sepulchre's was connected with the execution, in 1585, of Awfield, for &quot;sparcinge abrood certen lewed, sedicious, and traytorous bookes.&quot; &quot;When he was executed,&quot; says Fleetwood, the Recorder, in a letter to Lord Burleigh, July 7th of that year, &quot;his body was brought unto St. Pulcher's to be buryed, but the parishioners would not suffer a traytor's corpse to be laid in the earth where their parents, wives, children, kindred, masters, and old neighbours did rest; and so his carcass was returned to the burial-ground near Tyburn, and there I leave it.&quot;\n\nAnother event in the history of the church is a tale of suicide. On the 10th of April, 1600, a man named William Dorrington threw himself from the roof of the tower, leaving there a prayer for forgiveness.\n\nWe come now to speak of the connection of St. Sepulchre's with the neighbouring prison of Newgate. Being the nearest church to the prison, that connection naturally was intimate. Its clock served to give the time to the hangman when there was an execution in the Old Bailey, and many a poor wretch's last moments must it have regulated.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the altar a board with a list of charitable donations and gifts used to contain the following item:\u2014&quot;1605. Mr. Robert Dowe gave, for ringing the greatest bell in this church on the day the condemned prisoners are executed, and for other services, for ever, concerning such condemned prisoners, for which services the sexton is paid \u00a316s. 8d.\u2014\u00a350.\n\nIt was formerly the practice for the clerk or bellman of St. Sepulchre's to go under Newgate, on the night preceding the execution of a criminal, ring his bell, and repeat the following wholesome advice:\u2014\n\n&quot;All you that in the condemned hold do lie,\nPrepare you, for to-morrow you shall die;\nWatch all, and pray, the hour is drawing near\nThat you before the Almighty must appear;\nExamine well yourselves, in time repent,\nThat you may not to eternal flames be sent.\nAnd when St. Sepulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,\nThe Lord above have mercy on your souls.\nPast twelve o'clock!&quot;\n\nThis practice is explained by a passage in Munday's edition of Stow, in which it is told that a Mr. John Dowe, citizen and merchant taylor of London, gave \u00a350 to the parish church of St. Sepulchre's, under the following conditions:\u2014After the several sessions of London, on the night before the execution of such as were condemned to death, the clerk of the church was to go in the night-time, and also early in the morning, to the window of the prison in which they were lying. He was there to ring &quot;certain tolls with a hand-bell&quot; appointed for the purpose, and was afterwards, in a most Christian manner, to put them in mind of their present condition and approaching end, and to exhort them to be prepared, as they ought to be, to die. When they were in the cart, and brought before the walls of the church, the clerk was to stand there ready with the same bell, and, after certain tolls, rehearse a prayer, desiring all the people there present to pray for the unfortunate criminals. The beadle, also, of Merchant Taylors' Hall was allowed an &quot;honest stipend&quot; to see that this ceremony was regularly performed.\n\nThe affecting admonition\u2014&quot;affectingly good,&quot; Pennant calls it\u2014addressed to the prisoners in Newgate, on the night before execution, ran as follows:\u2014\n\n&quot;You prisoners that are within,\nWho, for wickedness and sin,\n\nafter many mercies shown you, are now appointed to die to-morrow in the forenoon; give ear and understand that, to-morrow morning, the greatest bell of St. Sepulchre's shall toll for you, in form and manner of a passing-bell, as used to be tolled for those that are at the point of death; to the end that all godly people, hearing that bell, and knowing it is for your going to your deaths, may be stirred up heartily to pray to God to bestow his grace and mercy upon you, whilst you live. I beseech you, for Jesus Christ's sake, to keep this night in watching and prayer, to the salvation of your own souls while there is yet time and place for mercy; as knowing to-morrow you must appear before the judgment-seat of your Creator, there to give an account of all things done in this life, and to suffer eternal torments for your sins committed against Him, unless, upon your hearty and unfeigned repentance, you find mercy through the merits, death, and passion of your only Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return to Him.&quot;\n\nAnd the following was the admonition to condemned criminals, as they were passing by St. Sepulchre's Church wall to execution:\u2014&quot; All good people, pray heartily unto God for these poor sinners, who are now going to their death, for whom this great bell doth toll.\n\n&quot;You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask mercy of the Lord, for the salvation of your own souls, through the [merits, death, and passion of Jesus Christ, who now sits at the right hand of God, to make intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto Him.\n\n&quot;Lord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.\nLord have mercy upon you;\nChrist have mercy upon you.&quot;\n\nThe charitable Mr. Dowe, who took such interest in the last moments of the occupants of the condemned cell, was buried in the church of St. Botolph, Aldgate.\n\nAnother curious custom observed at St. Sepulchre's was the presentation of a nosegay to every criminal on his way to execution at Tyburn. No doubt the practice had its origin in some kindly feeling for the poor unfortunates who were so soon to bid farewell to all the beauties of earth. One of the last who received a nosegay from the steps of St. Sepulchre's was &quot;Sixteen-string Jack,&quot; alias John Rann, who was hanged, in 1774, for robbing the Rev. Dr. Bell of his watch and eighteen pence in money, in Gunnersbury Lane, on the road to Brentford. Sixteen-string Jack wore the flowers in his button-hole as he rode dolefully to the gallows. This was witnessed by John Thomas Smith, who thus describes the scene in his admirable anecdotebook, &quot;Nollekens and his Times:&quot;\u2014&quot; I remember well, when I was in my eighth year, Mr. Nollekens calling at my father's house, in Great Portland Street, and taking us to Oxford Street, to see the notorious Jack Rann, commonly called Sixteenstring Jack, go to Tyburn to be hanged. \u2026 The criminal was dressed in a pea-green coat, with an immense nosegay in the button-hole, which had been presented to him at St. Sepulchre's steps; and his nankeen small-clothes, we were told, were tied at each knee with sixteen strings. After he had passed, and Mr. Nollekens was leading me home by the hand, I recollect his stooping down to me and observing, in a low tone of voice, 'Tom, now, my little man, if my father-in-law, Mr. Justice Welch, had been high constable, we could have walked by the side of the cart all the way to Tyburn.'&quot;\n\nWhen criminals were conveyed from Newgate to Tyburn, the cart passed up Giltspur Street, and through Smithfield, to Cow Lane. Skinner Street had not then been built, and the Crooked Lane which turned down by St. Sepulchre's, as well as Ozier Lane, did not afford sufficient width to admit of the cavalcade passing by either of them, with convenience, to Holborn Hill, or &quot;the Heavy Hill,&quot; as it used to be called. The procession seems at no time to have had much of the solemn element about it. &quot;The heroes of the day were often,&quot; says a popular writer, &quot;on good terms with the mob, and jokes were exchanged between the men who were going to be hanged and the men who deserved to be.&quot;\n\n&quot;On St. Paul's Day,&quot; says Mr. Timbs (1868), &quot;service is performed in St. Sepulchre's, in accordance with the will of Mr. Paul Jervis, who, in 1717, devised certain land in trust that a sermon should be preached in the church upon every Paul's Day upon the excellence of the liturgy o the Church of England; the preacher to receive 40s. for such sermon. Various sums are also bequeathed to the curate, the clerk, the treasurer, and masters of the parochial schools. To the poor of the parish he bequeathed 20s. a-piece to ten of the poorest householders within that part of the parish of St. Sepulchre commonly called Smithfield quarter, \u00a34 to the treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and 6s. 8d. yearly to the clerk, who shall attend to receive the same. The residue of the yearly rents and profits is to be distributed unto and amongst such poor people of the parish of St. Sepulchre's, London, who shall attend the service and sermon. At the close of the service the vestry-clerk reads aloud an extract from the will, and then proceeds to the distribution of the money. In the evening the vicar, churchwardens, and common councilmen of the precinct dine together.&quot;\n\nIn 1749, a Mr. Drinkwater made a praiseworthy bequest. He left the parish of St. Sepulchre \u00a3500 to be lent in sums of \u00a325 to industrious young tradesmen. No interest was to be charged, and the money was to be lent for four years.\n\nNext to St. Sepulchre's, on Snow Hill, used to stand the famous old inn of the &quot;Saracen's Head.&quot; It was only swept away within the last few years by the ruthless army of City improvers: a view of it in course of demolition was given on page 439. It was one of the oldest of the London inns which bore the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; for a sign. One of Dick Tarlton's jests makes mention of the &quot;Saracen's Head&quot; without Newgate, and Stow, describing this neighbourhood, speaks particularly of &quot;a fair large inn for receipt of travellers&quot; that &quot;hath to sign the 'Saracen's Head.'&quot; The courtyard had, to the last, many of the characteristics of an old English inn; there were galleries all round leading to the bedrooms, and a spacious gateway through which the dusty mail-coaches used to rumble, the tired passengers creeping forth &quot;thanking their stars in having escaped the highwaymen and the holes and sloughs of the road.&quot; Into that courtyard how many have come on their first arrival in London with hearts beating high with hope, some of whom have risen to be aldermen and sit in state as lord mayor, whilst others have gone the way of the idle apprentice and come to a sad end at Tyburn! It was at this inn that Nicholas Nickleby and his uncle waited upon the Yorkshire schoolmaster Squeers, of Dotheboys Hall. Mr. Dickens describes the tavern as it existed in the last days of mail-coaching, when it was a most important place for arrivals and departures in London:\u2014\n\n&quot;Next to the jail, and by consequence near to Smithfield also, and the Compter and the bustle and noise of the City, and just on that particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastwards seriously think of falling down on purpose, and where horses in hackney cabriolets going westwards not unfrequently fall by accident, is the coach-yard of the 'Saracen's Head' inn, its portals guarded by two Saracen's heads and shoulders, which it was once the pride and glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night, but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity, possibly because this species of humour is now confined to St. James's parish, where doorknockers are preferred as being more portable, and bell-wires esteemed as convenient tooth-picks. Whether this be the reason or not, there they are, frowning upon you from each side of the gateway; and the inn itself, garnished with another Saracen's head, frowns upon you from the top of the yard; while from the door of the hind-boot of all the red coaches that are standing therein, there glares a small Saracen's head with a twin expression to the large Saracen's head below, so that the general appearance of the pile is of the Saracenic order.&quot;\n\nTo explain the use of the Saracen's head as an inn sign various reasons have been given. &quot;When our countrymen,&quot; says Selden, &quot;came home from fighting with the Saracens and were beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible faces (as you still see the 'Saracen's Head' is), when in truth they were like other men. But this they did to save their own credit.&quot; Or the sign may have been adopted by those who had visited the Holy Land either as pilgrims or to fight the Saracens. Others, again, hold that it was first set up in compliment to the mother of Thomas \u00e0 Becket, who was the daughter of a Saracen. However this may be, it is certain that the use of the sign in former days was very general.\n\nRunning past the east end of St. Sepulchre's, from Newgate into West Smithfield, is Giltspur Street, anciently called Knightriders Street. This interesting thoroughfare derives its name from the knights with their gilt spurs having been accustomed to ride this way to the jousts and tournaments which in days of old were held in Smithfield.\n\nIn this street was Giltspur Street Compter, a debtors' prison and house of correction appertaining to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex. It stood over against St. Sepulchre's Church, and was removed hither from the east side of Wood Street, Cheapside, in 1791. At the time of its removal it was used as a place of imprisonment for debtors, but the yearly increasing demands upon the contracted space caused that department to be given up, and City debtors were sent to Whitecross Street. The architect was Dance, to whom we are also indebted for the grim pile of Newgate. The Compter was a dirty and appropriately convictlooking edifice. It was pulled down in 1855. Mr. Hepworth Dixon gave an interesting account of this City House of Correction, not long before its demolition, in his &quot;London Prisons&quot; (1850). &quot;Entering,&quot; he says, &quot;at the door facing St. Sepulchre's, the visitor suddenly finds himself in a low dark passage, leading into the offices of the gaol, and branching off into other passages, darker, closer, more replete with noxious smells, than even those of Newgate. This is the fitting prelude to what follows. The prison, it must be noticed, is divided into two principal divisions, the House of Correction and the Compter. The front in Giltspur Street, and the side nearest to Newgate Street, is called the Compter. In its wards are placed detenues of various kinds\u2014remands, committals from the police-courts, and generally persons waiting for trial, and consequently still unconvicted. The other department, the House of Correction, occupies the back portion of the premises, abutting on Christ's Hospital. Curious it is to consider how thin a wall divides these widely-separate worlds! And sorrowful it is to think what a difference of destiny awaits the children\u2014destiny inexorable, though often unearned in either case\u2014who, on the one side of it or the other, receive an eleemosynary education! The collegian and the criminal! Who shall say how much mere accident\u2014 circumstances over which the child has little power \u2014determines to a life of usefulness or mischief? From the yards of Giltspur Street prison almost the only objects visible, outside of the gaol itself, are the towers of Christ's Hospital; the only sounds audible, the shouts of the scholars at their play. The balls of the hospital boys often fall within the yards of the prison. Whether these sights and sounds ever cause the criminal to pause and reflect upon the courses of his life, we will not say, but the stranger visiting the place will be very apt to think for him. \u2026\n\n&quot;In the department of the prison called the House of Correction, minor offenders within the City of London are imprisoned. No transports are sent hither, nor is any person whose sentence is above three years in length.&quot; This able writer then goes on to tell of the many crying evils connected with the institution\u2014the want of air, the over-crowded state of the rooms, the absence of proper cellular accommodation, and the vicious intercourse carried on amongst the prisoners. The entire gaol, when he wrote, only contained thirty-six separate sleeping-rooms. Now by the highest prison calculation\u2014and this, be it noted, proceeds on the assumption that three persons can sleep in small, miserable, unventilated cells, which are built for only one, and are too confined for that, being only about one-half the size of the model cell for one at Pentonville\u2014it was only capable of accommodating 203 prisoners, yet by the returns issued at Michaelmas, 1850, it contained 246!\n\nA large section of the prison used to be devoted to female delinquents, but lately it was almost entirely given up to male offenders.\n\n&quot;The House of Correction, and the Compter portion of the establishment,&quot; says Mr. Dixon, &quot;are kept quite distinct, but it would be difficult to award the palm of empire in their respective facilities for demoralisation. We think the Compter rather the worse of the two. You are shown into a room, about the size of an apartment in an ordinary dwelling-house, which will be found crowded with from thirty to forty persons, young and old, and in their ordinary costume; the low thief in his filth and rags, and the member of the swell-mob with his bright buttons, flash finery, and false jewels. Here you notice the boy who has just been guilty of his first offence, and committed for trial, learning with a greedy mind a thousand criminal arts, and listening with the precocious instinct of guilty passions to stories and conversations the most depraved and disgusting. You regard him with a mixture of pity and loathing, for he knows that the eyes of his peers are upon him, and he stares at you with a familiar impudence, and exhibits a devil-may-care countenance, such as is only to be met with in the juvenile offender. Here, too, may be seen the young clerk, taken up on suspicion\u2014perhaps innocent\u2014who avoids you with a shy look of pain and uneasiness: what a hell must this prison be to him! How frightful it is to think of a person really untainted with crime, compelled to herd for ten or twenty days with these abandoned wretches!\n\n&quot;On the other, the House of Correction side of the gaol, similar rooms will be found, full of prisoners communicating with each other, laughing and shouting without hindrance. All this is so little in accordance with existing notions of prison discipline, that one is continually fancying these disgraceful scenes cannot be in the capital of England, and in the year of grace 1850. Very few of the prisoners attend school or receive any instruction; neither is any kind of employment afforded them, except oakum-picking, and the still more disgusting labour of the treadmill. When at work, an officer is in attendance to prevent disorderly conduct; but his presence is of no avail as a protection to the less depraved. Conversation still goes on; and every facility is afforded for making acquaintances, and for mutual contamination.&quot;\n\nAfter having long been branded by intelligent inspectors as a disgrace to the metropolis, Giltspur Street Compter was condemned, closed in 1854, and subsequently taken down.\n\nNearly opposite what used to be the site of the Compter, and adjoining Cock Lane, is the spot called Pie Corner, near which terminated the Great Fire of 1666. The fire commenced at Pudding Lane, it will be remembered, so it was singularly appropriate that it should terminate at Pie Corner. Under the date of 4th September, 1666, Pepys, in his &quot;Diary,&quot; records that &quot;W. Hewer this day went to see how his mother did, and comes home late, telling us how he hath been forced to remove her to Islington, her house in Pye Corner being burned; so that the fire is got so far that way.&quot; The figure of a fat naked boy stands over a public house at the corner of the lane; it used to have the following warning inscription attached:\u2014 &quot;This boy is in memory put up of the late fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony, 1666.&quot; According to Stow, Pie Corner derived its name from the sign of a well-frequented hostelry, which anciently stood on the spot. Strype makes honourable mention of Pie Corner, as &quot;noted chiefly for cooks' shops and pigs dressed there during Bartholomew Fair.&quot; Our old writers have many references\u2014and not all, by the way, in the best taste\u2014to its cookstalls and dressed pork. Shadwell, for instance, in the Woman Captain (1680) speaks of &quot;meat dressed at Pie Corner by greasy scullions;&quot; and Ben Jonson writes in the Alchemist (1612)\u2014\n\n&quot;I shall put you in mind, sir, at Pie Corner,\nTaking your meal of steam in from cooks' stalls.&quot;\n\nAnd in &quot;The Great Boobee&quot; (&quot;Roxburgh Ballads&quot;):\n\n&quot;Next day I through Pie Corner passed;\nThe roast meat on the stall\nInvited me to take a taste;\nMy money was but small.&quot;\n\nBut Pie Corner seems to have been noted for more than eatables. A ballad from Tom D'Urfey's &quot;Pills to Purge Melancholy,&quot; describing Bartholomew Fair, eleven years before the Fire of London, says:\u2014\n\n&quot;At Pie-Corner end, mark well my good friend,\n'Tis a very fine dirty place;\nWhere there's more arrows and bows. \u2026\nThan was handled at Chivy Chase.&quot;\n\nWe have already given a view of Pie Corner in our chapter on Smithfield, page 361.\n\nHosier Lane, running from Cow Lane to Smithfield, and almost parallel to Cock Lane, is described by &quot;R. B.,&quot; in Strype, as a place not over-well built or inhabited. The houses were all old timber erections. Some of these\u2014those standing at the south corner of the lane\u2014were in the beginning of this century depicted by Mr. J. T. Smith, in his &quot;Ancient Topography of London.&quot; He describes them as probably of the reign of James I. The rooms were small, with low, unornamented ceilings; the timber, oak, profusely used; the gables were plain, and the walls lath and plaster. They were taken down in 1809.\n\nIn the corner house, in Mr. Smith's time, there was a barber whose name was Catchpole; at least, so it was written over the door. He was rather an odd fellow, and possessed, according to his own account, a famous relic of antiquity. He would gravely show his customers a short-bladed instrument, as the identical dagger with which Walworth killed Wat Tyler.\n\nHosier Lane, like Pie Corner, used to be a great resort during the time of Bartholomew Fair, &quot;all the houses,&quot; it is said in Strype, &quot;generally being made public for tippling.&quot;\n\nWe return now from our excursion to the north of St. Sepulchre's, and continue our rambles to the west, and before speaking of what is, let us refer to what has been.\n\nTurnagain Lane is not far from this. &quot;Near unto this Seacoal Lane,&quot; remarks Stow, &quot;in the turning towards Holborn Conduit, is Turnagain Lane, or rather, as in a record of the 5th of Edward III., Windagain Lane, for that it goeth down west to Fleet Dyke, from whence men must turn again the same way they came, but there it stopped.&quot; There used to be a proverb, &quot;He must take him a house in Turnagain Lane.&quot;\n\nA conduit formerly stood on Snow Hill, a little below the church. It is described as a building with four equal sides, ornamented with four columns and pediment, surmounted by a pyramid, on which stood a lamb\u2014a rebus on the name of Lamb, from whose conduit in Red Lion Street the water came. There had been a conduit there, however, before Lamb's day, which was towards the close of the sixteenth century.\n\nAt No. 37, King Street, Snow Hill, there used to be a ladies' charity school, which was established in 1702, and remained in the parish 145 years. Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale were subscribers to this school, and Johnson drew from it his story of Betty Broom, in &quot;The Idler.&quot; The world of domestic service, in Betty's days, seems to have been pretty much as now. Betty was a poor girl, bred in the country at a charity-school, maintained by the contributions of wealthy neighbours. The patronesses visited the school from time to time, to see how the pupils got on, and everything went well, till &quot;at last, the chief of the subscribers having passed a winter in London, came down full of an opinion new and strange to the whole country. She held it little less than criminal to teach poor girls to read and write. They who are born to poverty, she said, are born to ignorance, and will work the harder the less they know. She told her friends that London was in confusion by the insolence of servants; that scarcely a girl could be got for all-work, since education had made such numbers of fine ladies, that nobody would now accept a lower title than that of a waiting-maid, or something that might qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles, and to sit at work in the parlour window. But she was resolved, for her part, to spoil no more girls. Those who were to live by their hands should neither read nor write out of her pocket. The world was bad enough already, and she would have no part in making it worse.\n\n&quot;She was for a long time warmly opposed; but she persevered in her notions, and withdrew her subscription. Few listen, without a desire of conviction, to those who advise them to spare their money. Her example and her arguments gained ground daily; and in less than a year the whole parish was convinced that the nation would be ruined if the children of the poor were taught to read and write.&quot; So the school was dissolved, and Betty with the rest was turned adrift into the wide and cold world; and her adventures there any one may read in &quot;The Idler&quot; for himself.\n\nThere is an entry in the school minutes of 1763, to the effect that the ladies of the committee censured the schoolmistress for listening to the story of the Cock Lane ghost, and &quot;desired her to keep her belief in the article to herself.&quot;\n\nSkinner Street\u2014now one of the names of the past\u2014which ran by the south side of St. Sepulchre's, and formed the connecting link between Newgate Street and Holborn, received its name from Alderman Skinner, through whose exertions, about 1802, it was principally built. The following account of Skinner Street is from the picturesque pen of Mr. William Harvey (&quot;Aleph&quot;), whose long familiarity with the places he describes renders doubly valuable his many contributions to the history of London scenes and people:\u2014&quot;As a building speculation,&quot; he says, writing in 1863, &quot;it was a failure. When the buildings were ready for occupation, tall and substantial as they really were, the high rents frightened intending shopkeepers. Tenants were not to be had; and in order to get over the money difficulty, a lottery, sanctioned by Parliament, was commenced. Lotteries were then common tricks of finance, and nobody wondered at the new venture; but even the most desperate fortune-hunters were slow to invest their capital, and the tickets hung sadly on hand. The day for the drawing was postponed several times, and when it came, there was little or no excitement on the subject, and whoever rejoiced in becoming a house-owner on such easy terms, the original projectors and builders were understood to have suffered considerably. The winners found the property in a very unfinished condition. Few of the dwellings were habitable, and as funds were often wanting, a majority of the houses remained empty, and the shops unopened. After two or three years things began to improve; the vast many-storeyed house which then covered the site of Commercial Place was converted into a warehousing dep\u00f4t; a capital house opposite the 'Saracen's Head' was taken by a hosier of the name of Theobald, who, opening his shop with the determination of selling the best hosiery, and nothing else, was able to convince the citizens that his hose was first-rate, and, desiring only a living profit, succeeded, after thirty years of unwearied industry, in accumulating a large fortune. Theobald was possessed of literary tastes, and at the sale of Sir Walter Scott's manuscripts was a liberal purchaser. He also collected a library of exceedingly choice books, and when aristocratic customers purchased stockings of him, was soon able to interest them in matters of far higher interest\u2026\n\n&quot;The most remarkable shop\u2014but it was on the left-hand side, at a corner house\u2014was that established for the sale of children's books. It boasted an immense extent of window-front, extending from the entrance into Snow Hill, and towards Fleet Market. Many a time have I lingered with loving eyes over those fascinating story-books, so rich in gaily-coloured prints; such careful editions of the marvellous old histories, 'Puss in Boots,' 'Cock Robin,' 'Cinderella,' and the like. Fortunately the front was kept low, so as exactly to suit the capacity of a childish admirer. . . . . But Skinner Street did not prosper much, and never could compete with even the dullest portions of Holborn. I have spoken of some reputable shops; but you know the proverb, 'One swallow will not make a summer,' and it was a declining neighbourhood almost before it could be called new. In 1810 the commercial dep\u00f4t, which had been erected at a cost of \u00a325,000, and was the chief prize in the lottery, was destroyed by fire, never to be rebuilt\u2014a heavy blow and discouragement to Skinner Street, from which it never rallied. Perhaps the periodical hanging-days exercised an unfavourable influence, collecting, as they frequently did, all the thieves and vagabonds of London. I never sympathised with Pepys or Charles Fox in their passion for public executions, and made it a point to avoid those ghastly sights; but early of a Monday morning, when I had just reached the end of Giltspur Street, a miserable wretch had just been turned off from the platform of the debtors' door, and I was made the unwilling witness of his last struggles. That scene haunted me for months, and I often used to ask myself, 'Who that could help it would live in Skinner Street?' The next unpropitious event in these parts was the unexpected closing of the child's library. What could it mean? Such a well-to-do establishment shut up? Yes, the whole army of shutters looked blankly on the inquirer, and forbade even a single glance at 'Sinbad' or 'Robinson Crusoe.' It would soon be re-opened, we naturally thought; but the shutters never came down again. The whole house was deserted; not even a messenger in bankruptcy, or an ancient Charley, was found to regard the playful double knocks of the neighbouring juveniles. Gradually the glass of all the windows got broken in, a heavy cloud of black dust, solidifying into inches thick, gathered on sills and doors and brickwork, till the whole frontage grew as gloomy as Giant Despair's Castle. Not long after, the adjoining houses shared the same fate, and they remained from year to year without the slightest sign of life\u2014absolute scarecrows, darkening with their uncomfortable shadows the busy streets. Within half a mile, in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, there are (1863) seven houses in a similar predicament\u2014 window-glass demolished, doors cracked from top to bottom, spiders' webs hanging from every projecting sill or parapet. What can it mean? The loss in the article of rents alone must be over \u00a31,000 annually. If the real owners are at feud with imaginary owners, surely the property might be rendered valuable, and the proceeds invested. Even the lawyers can derive no profit from such hopeless abandonment. I am told the whole mischief arose out of a Chancery suit. Can it be the famous 'Jarndyce v. Jarndyce' case? And have all the heirs starved each other out? If so, what hinders our lady the Queen from taking possession? Any change would be an improvement, for these dead houses make the streets they cumber as dispiriting and comfortless as graveyards. Busy fancy will sometimes people them, and fill the dreary rooms with strange guests. Do the victims of guilt congregate in these dark dens? Do wretches 'unfriended by the world or the world's law,' seek refuge in these deserted nooks, mourning in the silence of despair over their former lives, and anticipating the future in unappeasable agony? Such things have been\u2014the silence and desolation of these doomed dwellings make them the more suitable for such tenants.&quot;\n\nA street is nothing without a mystery, so a mystery let these old tumble-down houses remain, whilst we go on to tell that, in front of No. 58, the sailor Cashman was hung in 1817, as we have already mentioned, for plundering a gunsmith's shop there. William Godwin, the author of &quot;Caleb Williams,&quot; kept a bookseller's shop for several years in Skinner Street, at No. 41, and published school-books in the name of Edward Baldwin. On the wall there was a stone carving of \u00c6sop reciting one of his fables to children.\n\nThe most noteworthy event of the life of Godwin was his marriage with the celebrated Mary Wollstonecraft, authoress of a &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Women,&quot; whose congenial mind, in politics and morals, he ardently admired. Godwin's account of the way in which they got on together is worth reading:\u2014&quot;Ours,&quot; he writes, &quot;was not an idle happiness, a paradise of selfish and transitory pleasures. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to mention, that influenced by ideas I had long entertained, I engaged an apartment about twenty doors from our house, in the Polygon, Somers Town, which I designed for the purpose of my study and literary occupations. Trifles, however, will be interesting to some readers, when they relate to the last period of the life of such a person as Mary. I will add, therefore, that we were both of us of opinion, that it was possible for two persons to be too uniformly in each other's society. Influenced by that opinion, it was my practice to repair to the apartment I have mentioned as soon as I rose, and frequently not to make my appearance in the Polygon till the hour of dinner. We agreed in condemning the notion, prevalent in many situations in life, that a man and his wife cannot visit in mixed society but in company with each other, and we rather sought occasions of deviating from than of complying with this rule. By this means, though, for the most part, we spent the latter half of each day in one another's society, yet we were in no danger of satiety. We seemed to combine, in a considerable degree, the novelty and lively sensation of a visit with the more delicious and heartfelt pleasure of a domestic life.&quot;\n\nThis philosophic union, to Godwin's inexpressible affliction, did not last more than eighteen months, at the end of which time Mrs. Godwin died, leaving an only daughter, who in the course of time became the second wife of the poet Shelley, and was the author of the wild and extraordinary tale of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=45116<\/a>"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Jelltex","count_faves":"4","count_comments":"0","can_comment":0,"permissions":{"permcomment":1},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":72,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":172,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":229,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":358,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":458,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":572,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7563\/15788181192_2943bc90b0_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":733,"pathalias":"jelltecks"},{"id":"30535529001","owner":"142205655@N06","secret":"676dabdb64","server":"5453","farm":6,"title":"Dr Thomas David Morrison","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"MORRISON, THOMAS DAVID, clerk, physician, and politician; b. c. 1796, son of William Morrison; m. 2 Sept. 1818 Effie Gilbert, n\u00e9e Patrick, in York (Toronto); d. 19 March 1856 in Toronto.\n\nThomas David Morrison was born at Quebec, where his father was senior clerk of works in the Royal Engineers department at the time of his death in 1842. During the War of 1812 the young Morrison served as a clerk in the purveyor\u2019s branch of the British army\u2019s medical department; following his reduction he became, by 1816, a clerk in the office of the surveyor general in York. In 1818 he married the sister of William Poyntz Patrick, a clerk in the House of Assembly and a prominent Methodist. Originally an Anglican, Morrison participated that year in the organization of the first Methodist church in York. In June 1822 he was dismissed by Surveyor General Thomas Ridout* for uttering \u201clanguages\u201d and advancing \u201copinions very unbecoming a person employed in one of His Majesty\u2019s public offices.\u201d Some time after his dismissal he reputedly travelled to the United States to pursue a medical education. Returning to York, he was examined on 5 July 1824, by Christopher Widmer, Grant Powell*, and Robert Charles Horne* of the Medical Board of Upper Canada, and was licensed to practise \u201cPhysic, Surgery and Midwifery.\u201d\n\nMorrison prospered as a physician, establishing a large practice in the town as well as \u201cin the country up Yonge Street.\u201d An active member of the profession, he served on the ad hoc board of health set up in York during the cholera outbreak of 1832, and was courageously involved in fighting the more virulent outbreaks of 1834. In 1832 he had joined his friends and fellow physicians William Warren Baldwin* and John E. Tims in administering the York Dispensary, which opened on 22 August. It lasted about eight months, during which time it prescribed and distributed free medicine to 746 patients, at a cost of \u00a3118 3s. 4d. In early 1836 Morrison was appointed to the Medical Board, a position he held until the winter of 1837\u201338. Active in other areas of the community, he served as vice president of the bible society, trustee of the York General Burying Ground, and common school trustee.\n\nIn politics Morrison played an important role in the reform agitation of the 1820s, though never with the driving spirit of William Lyon Mackenzie* or with the intellectual input of Baldwin, John Rolph*, or Marshall Spring Bidwell*. Morrison was a talented orator, and therefore much in demand in a highly politicized community where public meetings and demonstrations were occurring with increasing regularity.\n\nMorrison first sought public office, for the town of York, in the provincal election of 1828, amid the furore caused by Lieutenant Governor Sir Peregrine Maitland\u2019s dismissal of Judge John Walpole Willis*. A committee of radical reformers, including Mackenzie, Jesse Ketchum*, and Francis Collins*, assembled in York in January to select a candidate to oppose Attorney General John Beverley Robinson*, a leading figure in the dismissal of Willis. Although some reformers put forward the more moderate Robert Baldwin, Morrison was chosen. William Warren Baldwin, Robert\u2019s father and himself a candidate in Norfolk, nominated Morrison on the hustings, evidence perhaps of the solidarity and resolve of the reformers. Unfortunately, their exertions in York were to no avail: Robinson was declared elected by 110 votes to 93. The return was challenged by Morrison on the grounds of illegal votes and reputed irregularities on the part of the returning officer, William Botsford Jarvis*. Although Morrison\u2019s case was eloquently argued by the Baldwins, Robinson\u2019s election was upheld. The reformers, however, had won a majority of seats throughout the province, which they enjoyed until 1830 and again in 1834\u201336.\n\nIn the first municipal elections for the city of Toronto, held in 1834, Morrison was elected alderman for St Andrew\u2019s Ward on a reform-dominated council. During the negotiations within council over who would be mayor, he voted to support the nomination of Mackenzie. Having assumed the role of intermediary, however, he was chosen to read to council John Rolph\u2019s letter of resignation as an alderman because he had expected to become mayor. In the provincial election of 1834, in which the reformers swept the four ridings of York County, Morrison finally gained a seat, for 3rd York. Returned as an alderman in 1835 and again in 1836, when the reformers regained the majority in council they had lost the previous year, he was elected in January 1836 to a one-year term as mayor.\n\nAlthough during Morrison\u2019s mayoralty, council spent some of its time on municipal business such as building a water-works and lighting the streets with gas, like previous councils it was preoccupied with provincial political controversies [see William Lyon Mackenzie]. In February 1836 Morrison, as mayor, signed an optimistic address of welcome to the new lieutenant governor, Sir Francis Bond Head*, who, it was hoped, would help secure reform. When John Rolph, John Henry Dunn, and Robert Baldwin resigned from the Executive Council the next month and Mackenzie was defeated in the provincial election in July (the result, he claimed, of the lieutenant governor\u2019s having \u201cunduly interfered with the election\u201d), the reformers once again used city council as a platform. Morrison himself had been re-elected to the House of Assembly that summer and he did not serve on city council again after the end of his mayoralty.\n\nAs the demands for reform intensified in 1837, Morrison continued to play a leading public role, especially in the assembly. Among the radicals, however, he was beginning to hold back. He attended the meeting of reformers at John Doel*\u2019s brewery in July and seconded a motion by Mackenzie congratulating the reformers in Lower Canada. Then, though hesitant, he signed the reform declaration drafted at that meeting and was made a member of the Central Vigilance Committee. He chaired a second meeting at Doel\u2019s brewery in October, at which time he refused to support Mackenzie\u2019s plan for revolt.\n\nMorrison, like other leading reformers in the city such as Rolph, Bidwell, and William Warren Baldwin (with whom he probably consulted), was unwilling to participate openly in Mackenzie\u2019s plan to raise a force in the country and march on Toronto. According to Charles Lindsey*, he \u201cremained in his house\u201d during the abortive uprising. Upon the collapse of the rebellion, however, he was arrested by the militia on 6 December and held without bail, remaining in jail until his trial the following spring.\n\nMorrison\u2019s trial for high treason opened on 24 April 1838 under the pall created by the executions of Samuel Lount* and Peter Matthews*, who had been hanged 12 days previously. Morrison was indeed fighting for his life. Moreover, his defence, led by Robert Baldwin, was exacerbated by Mackenzie\u2019s pronouncements from across the border and by the compromising evidence of Morrison\u2019s signature on the reform declaration of July 1837. In the end he was found not guilty, though the jury enquired about finding him guilty of misprision of treason, a lesser crime. The prospect of being tried on this charge terrified Morrison, who, according to John Ryerson*, believed that since \u201cthey were bent on his destruction &amp; that they would accomplish it, he had better leave as Mr. Bidwell had done.\u201d On 29 April 1838 Morrison left Toronto for the United States.\n\nHe remained in exile for five years, settling in upstate New York near Batavia, where after some time he was able to establish himself in medical practice. But he was clearly not happy and toyed with the idea of moving to Michigan. In 1843, following the Canadian government\u2019s declaration of amnesty, he returned to Toronto and re-established his practice. Unlike Rolph, and later Mackenzie, he did not again seek public office. Instead he concentrated on his medical career, serving on hospital boards and lecturing at Rolph\u2019s Toronto School of Medicine. In 1851 Morrison was appointed to the reconstituted Medical Board as part of Rolph\u2019s machinations against the University of Toronto\u2019s medical faculty [see Christopher Widmer]. He died of palsy at his home on Adelaide Street on 19 March 1856.\n\nMorrison\u2019s political career was inextricably connected with the fortunes of the provincial reform movement that was crushed in 1837. At the height of his career, in 1836\u201337, he played an important but not pivotal role in shaping events of the day. He was a respectable supporter of the great ones around him who, unlike Morrison, survived the defeat of December 1837."},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Toronto Cemetery Walker","realname":"Shannon Stafford","count_faves":"0","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":56,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":135,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":180,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":281,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":360,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":450,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5453\/30535529001_676dabdb64_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":576,"pathalias":null},{"id":"5900569513","owner":"40687512@N06","secret":"43edbbfe6d","server":"6019","farm":7,"title":"7) Half-Marathoners from Ottawa, Gatineau & Area: stats and pics (Jed - Judi)","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":0,"license":"1","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"\nThere are 15 web pages listing Ottawa, Gatineau &amp; area half marathoners.

Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge. Thar Express to Karachi and the more famous Samjhauta Express international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar (Attari).\nBangladesh \u2013 Same Broad Gauge. The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan. The train has a 7 nights &amp; 8 days itinerary, it departs from New Delhi (Day 1), and covers Jaipur (Day 2), Sawai Madhopur and Chittaurgarh (Day 3), Udaipur (Day 4), Jaisalmer (Day 5), Jodhpur (Day 6), Bharatpur and Agra (Day 7), return to Delhi (Day 8).\n\nRoyal Rajasthan on Wheels a luxury tourist train service covers various tourist destinations in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"1","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_t.jpg","height_t":67,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_m.jpg","height_s":160,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_n.jpg","height_n":213,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945.jpg","height_m":333,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_z.jpg","height_z":427,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_c.jpg","height_c":533,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1757\/28650239978_13f3543945_b.jpg","height_l":683,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"26455674701","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"112469ea28","server":"1474","farm":2,"title":"India - Rajasthan - Jaisalmer - Railway Station - 3","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"Indian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge.

The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan. The train has a 7 nights &amp; 8 days itinerary, it departs from New Delhi (Day 1), and covers Jaipur (Day 2), Sawai Madhopur and Chittaurgarh (Day 3), Udaipur (Day 4), Jaisalmer (Day 5), Jodhpur (Day 6), Bharatpur and Agra (Day 7), return to Delhi (Day 8).\n\nRoyal Rajasthan on Wheels a luxury tourist train service covers various tourist destinations in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"1","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_t.jpg","height_t":56,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_m.jpg","height_s":135,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_n.jpg","height_n":180,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28.jpg","height_m":281,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_z.jpg","height_z":360,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_c.jpg","height_c":450,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1474\/26455674701_112469ea28_b.jpg","height_l":576,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"27020014266","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"7baa518df8","server":"7272","farm":8,"title":"India - Kerala - Varkala - Railway Station","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"Indian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge. Thar Express to Karachi and the more famous Samjhauta Express international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar (Attari).\nBangladesh \u2013 Same Broad Gauge. The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan. The train has a 7 nights &amp; 8 days itinerary, it departs from New Delhi (Day 1), and covers Jaipur (Day 2), Sawai Madhopur and Chittaurgarh (Day 3), Udaipur (Day 4), Jaisalmer (Day 5), Jodhpur (Day 6), Bharatpur and Agra (Day 7), return to Delhi (Day 8).\n\nRoyal Rajasthan on Wheels a luxury tourist train service covers various tourist destinations in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"3","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_t.jpg","height_t":56,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_m.jpg","height_s":135,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_n.jpg","height_n":180,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8.jpg","height_m":281,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_z.jpg","height_z":360,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_c.jpg","height_c":450,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7272\/27020014266_7baa518df8_b.jpg","height_l":576,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"23618834460","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"0dba08dd43","server":"5772","farm":6,"title":"India - Maharashtra - Mumbai - Train To Goa - 2","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"Indian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year.On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets.Railways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013 . As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge. Thar Express to Karachi and the more famous Samjhauta Express international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar (Attari).\nBangladesh \u2013 Same Broad Gauge. The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"2","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_t.jpg","height_t":67,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_m.jpg","height_s":160,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_n.jpg","height_n":213,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43.jpg","height_m":333,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_z.jpg","height_z":427,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_c.jpg","height_c":533,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5772\/23618834460_0dba08dd43_b.jpg","height_l":683,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"36484580576","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"4d1b98f96a","server":"4345","farm":5,"title":"India - Indian Railway - Ordinary Class - 2bb","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":". . . this is the night-train from Chennai to Hyderabad. \nDuration: 15 hours - Ticket: 2 Euro!\n________________________________________\n\nIndian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge. Thar Express to Karachi and the more famous Samjhauta Express international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar (Attari).\nBangladesh \u2013 Same Broad Gauge. The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan. The train has a 7 nights &amp; 8 days itinerary, it departs from New Delhi (Day 1), and covers Jaipur (Day 2), Sawai Madhopur and Chittaurgarh (Day 3), Udaipur (Day 4), Jaisalmer (Day 5), Jodhpur (Day 6), Bharatpur and Agra (Day 7), return to Delhi (Day 8).\n\nRoyal Rajasthan on Wheels a luxury tourist train service covers various tourist destinations in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"0","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_t.jpg","height_t":67,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_m.jpg","height_s":160,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_n.jpg","height_n":213,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a.jpg","height_m":333,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_z.jpg","height_z":427,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_c.jpg","height_c":533,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4345\/36484580576_4d1b98f96a_b.jpg","height_l":683,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"23806266432","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"1618f07c5e","server":"629","farm":1,"title":"India - Maharashtra - Mumbai - Train To Goa - 1","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"Indian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year.On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets.Railways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013 . As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge. Thar Express to Karachi and the more famous Samjhauta Express international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar (Attari).\nBangladesh \u2013 Same Broad Gauge. The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan. The train has a 7 nights &amp; 8 days itinerary, it departs from New Delhi (Day 1), and covers Jaipur (Day 2), Sawai Madhopur and Chittaurgarh (Day 3), Udaipur (Day 4), Jaisalmer (Day 5), Jodhpur (Day 6), Bharatpur and Agra (Day 7), return to Delhi (Day 8).\n\nRoyal Rajasthan on Wheels a luxury tourist train service covers various tourist destinations in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"3","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_t.jpg","height_t":67,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_m.jpg","height_s":160,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_n.jpg","height_n":213,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e.jpg","height_m":333,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_z.jpg","height_z":427,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_c.jpg","height_c":533,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/629\/23806266432_1618f07c5e_b.jpg","height_l":683,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"9766044393","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"5697ac298e","server":"2837","farm":3,"title":"India - West Bengal - Kolkata - Railway Compartment - 1","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"Indian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year.On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets.Railways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013 . As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge. Thar Express to Karachi and the more famous Samjhauta Express international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar (Attari).\nBangladesh \u2013 Same Broad Gauge. The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"1","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_t.jpg","height_t":67,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_m.jpg","height_s":160,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_n.jpg","height_n":213,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e.jpg","height_m":333,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_z.jpg","height_z":427,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_c.jpg","height_c":533,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/2837\/9766044393_5697ac298e_b.jpg","height_l":683,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"23048522626","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"5fce44561c","server":"5716","farm":6,"title":"India - Indian Railways - Second Class Seat - 1","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":". . . this is the night-train from Chennai to Hyderabad. \nDuration: 15 hours - Ticket: 2 Euro!\n________________________________________\n\nIndian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge. Thar Express to Karachi and the more famous Samjhauta Express international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar (Attari).\nBangladesh \u2013 Same Broad Gauge. The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"2","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_t.jpg","height_t":75,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_m.jpg","height_s":179,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_n.jpg","height_n":239,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c.jpg","height_m":373,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_z.jpg","height_z":478,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_c.jpg","height_c":597,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5716\/23048522626_5fce44561c_b.jpg","height_l":765,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"22453323223","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"cde242d9d1","server":"5732","farm":6,"title":"India - Indian Railways - Second Class Seat - 4","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":". . . this is the night-train from Chennai to Hyderabad.

It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge. Thar Express to Karachi and the more famous Samjhauta Express international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar (Attari).\nBangladesh \u2013 Same Broad Gauge. The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan. The train has a 7 nights &amp; 8 days itinerary, it departs from New Delhi (Day 1), and covers Jaipur (Day 2), Sawai Madhopur and Chittaurgarh (Day 3), Udaipur (Day 4), Jaisalmer (Day 5), Jodhpur (Day 6), Bharatpur and Agra (Day 7), return to Delhi (Day 8).\n\nRoyal Rajasthan on Wheels a luxury tourist train service covers various tourist destinations in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"0","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_t.jpg","height_t":67,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_m.jpg","height_s":160,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_n.jpg","height_n":213,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1.jpg","height_m":333,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_z.jpg","height_z":427,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_c.jpg","height_c":533,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5732\/22453323223_cde242d9d1_b.jpg","height_l":683,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"25916834334","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"6db92d4d0b","server":"1549","farm":2,"title":"India - Rajasthan - Jaisalmer - Indian Railway Second Class","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"Indian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge.

A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan. The train has a 7 nights &amp; 8 days itinerary, it departs from New Delhi (Day 1), and covers Jaipur (Day 2), Sawai Madhopur and Chittaurgarh (Day 3), Udaipur (Day 4), Jaisalmer (Day 5), Jodhpur (Day 6), Bharatpur and Agra (Day 7), return to Delhi (Day 8).\n\nRoyal Rajasthan on Wheels a luxury tourist train service covers various tourist destinations in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"2","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_t.jpg","height_t":56,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_m.jpg","height_s":135,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_n.jpg","height_n":180,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b.jpg","height_m":281,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_z.jpg","height_z":360,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_c.jpg","height_c":450,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/1549\/25916834334_6db92d4d0b_b.jpg","height_l":576,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"22451753994","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"8dfaf812c4","server":"5668","farm":6,"title":"India - Indian Railways - Second Class Seat - 3","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":". . . this is the night train from Chennai to Hyderabad. \nDuration: 15 hours - Ticket: 2 Euro!\n________________________________________\n\nIndian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge. Thar Express to Karachi and the more famous Samjhauta Express international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar (Attari).\nBangladesh \u2013 Same Broad Gauge. The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan. The train has a 7 nights &amp; 8 days itinerary, it departs from New Delhi (Day 1), and covers Jaipur (Day 2), Sawai Madhopur and Chittaurgarh (Day 3), Udaipur (Day 4), Jaisalmer (Day 5), Jodhpur (Day 6), Bharatpur and Agra (Day 7), return to Delhi (Day 8).\n\nRoyal Rajasthan on Wheels a luxury tourist train service covers various tourist destinations in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"3","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_t.jpg","height_t":100,"width_t":67,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_m.jpg","height_s":240,"width_s":160,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_n.jpg","height_n":320,"width_n":213,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4.jpg","height_m":500,"width_m":333,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_z.jpg","height_z":640,"width_z":427,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_c.jpg","height_c":800,"width_c":533,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5668\/22451753994_8dfaf812c4_b.jpg","height_l":1024,"width_l":683,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"22736039397","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"c8451e4060","server":"627","farm":1,"title":"India - Assam - Guwahati - Northeast Frontier Railway 1958 - Steam Locomotive North East Queen YG-4119 - 2","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":0,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"The YG class meter gauge locomotive was built in 1956 by Wiener Lokomotivfabrik, Floridsdorf, Germany.\n\nIt was serving Badarpur Steam Loco Shed of NFR and was retired from service in 1997.\n______________________________________________\n\nIndian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge. Thar Express to Karachi and the more famous Samjhauta Express international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar (Attari).\nBangladesh \u2013 Same Broad Gauge. The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"8","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_t.jpg","height_t":34,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_m.jpg","height_s":82,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_n.jpg","height_n":109,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060.jpg","height_m":171,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_z.jpg","height_z":218,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_c.jpg","height_c":273,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/627\/22736039397_c8451e4060_b.jpg","height_l":349,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"23166141471","owner":"98403995@N08","secret":"6bb7d335d6","server":"671","farm":1,"title":"India - Assam - Guwahati - Northeast Frontier Railway 1958 - Steam Locomotive North East Queen YG-4119 - 1","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"The YG class meter gauge locomotive was built in 1956 by Wiener Lokomotivfabrik, Floridsdorf, Germany.\n\nIt was serving Badarpur Steam Loco Shed of NFR and was retired from service in 1997.\n______________________________________________\n\nIndian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge.

The Maitri Express between Dhaka and Kolkata started in April 2008 using the Gede-Darsana route, in addition to a Freight Train service from Singhabad and Petrapole in India to Rohanpur and Benapole in Bangladesh. A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan. The train has a 7 nights &amp; 8 days itinerary, it departs from New Delhi (Day 1), and covers Jaipur (Day 2), Sawai Madhopur and Chittaurgarh (Day 3), Udaipur (Day 4), Jaisalmer (Day 5), Jodhpur (Day 6), Bharatpur and Agra (Day 7), return to Delhi (Day 8).\n\nRoyal Rajasthan on Wheels a luxury tourist train service covers various tourist destinations in Rajasthan.

However, hostilities between the two nations in 2001 saw the line being closed. It was reopened when the hostilities subsided in 2004. Another train connecting Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and Munabao (India) is the Thar Express that restarted operations on 18 February 2006; it was earlier closed down after the 1965 Indo-Pak war.\n\n- Lifeline Express is a special train popularly known as the &quot;Hospital-on-Wheels&quot; which provides healthcare to the rural areas. This train has a carriage that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.\n\n- Fairy Queen is the oldest operating locomotive in the world today, though it is operated only for specials between Delhi and Alwar. John Bull, a locomotive older than Fairy Queen, operated in 1981 commemorating its 150th anniversary. Gorakhpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world's longest railway platform at 1,366 m. The Ghum station along the Darjeeling Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. The Mumbai\u2013Pune Deccan Queen has the oldest running dining car in IR.\n\n- Vivek Express, between Dibrugarh and Kanyakumari, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 4,286 km in about 82 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n- Bhopal Shatabdi Express is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 160 km\/h on the Faridabad\u2013Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184 km\/h in 2000 during test runs.\n\n- Special Trains are those trains started by Indian Railways for any specific event or cause which includes Jagriti Yatra trains, Kumbh Mela Trains., emergency trains, etc.\n\n- Double-decker AC trains have been introduced in India. The first double decker train was Pune-Mumbai Sinhagad express plying between Pune and Mumbai while the first double-decker AC train in the Indian Railways was introduced in November 2010, running between the Dhanbad and Howrah stations having 10 coaches and 2 power cars. On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"7","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_t.jpg","height_t":67,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_m.jpg","height_s":160,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_n.jpg","height_n":213,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6.jpg","height_m":333,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_z.jpg","height_z":427,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_c.jpg","height_c":533,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/671\/23166141471_6bb7d335d6_b.jpg","height_l":683,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"11233368994","owner":"65711201@N00","secret":"2ac634d70d","server":"7432","farm":8,"title":"Get 70% OFF!","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":0,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"<a href=\"http:\/\/61c5.ybfdoctor.ru\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">61c5.ybfdoctor.ru\/<\/a>\n\nOn average it takes 42 minutes to complete the entire route, half an hour near the last runs at the end of the night.\nPrivatus whose relics were discovered at Mende in 1170.\nPapers of Irving Berlin, Dwight D.

C. Hughson, Ottawa An outstanding figure in the ranks o'f the lumbermen in the Ottawa and Gatineau Valley dis- trict joined the silent majority lately in the person of Ward Campbell Hughson, president of Gilmour &amp; Hughson, Limited, Hull, Que. Mr. Hughson, who was in his 66th year, had been ailing for some time, and passed away at his home, 71 Bronson Ave., Ottawa. He was held in high regard by a large circle of friends and business acquaint- ances and is survived by his widow, two daughters and two sons. In addition to his active interests in the firm of Gilmour &amp; Hughson, he was a director of the Ottawa River Forest Protec- tive Association of which he was president for four years. He was also a member of the directorate of the Lower Ottawa Boom Co. for twenty-seven years, and was head of that organization for nine- teen years, as well as president of W. C. Hughson &amp; Sons, Limited. Mr. Hughson was born in Albany, N.Y., and was the son of a well- known lumberman, who was head of the firm of Hughson &amp; Co., of Albany. The late Mr. Hughson received his business training under his father and came to Canada in the eighties and was engaged for a time in the lumber line in Peterboro. He was later manager of the Muskoka Mills and Lumber Company, near Penetanguishene, Ont., was associated in business with Mr. A. S. Campbell, of Toronto, and later took up residence in Ottawa as the representative of Hughson &amp; Co., of Albany. The firm of Gilmour &amp; Hughson Company, Limi- ted, was formed in 1891, with the late John Gilmour as president. On the death of Mr. Gilmour in 1912, Mr. Hughson succeeded to the presidency of the firm, henceforth known as Gilmour and Hughson, Limited, of Hull, and retained this office ever since. Three years ago, the firm entered into and made agreement of sale with the Riordon Corporation. Mr. Hughson had resided continuously in Ottawa since 1890, and although born in Albany, was a naturalized British subject. Mr. Ainslie Passes Away at Owen Sound One of the pioneer lumbermen of Northern Ontario in the per- son of John George Ainslie, passed away lately in Owen Sound in his 65th year. He was raised at Leith, a few miles out of the city and spent his whole life in the district. Mr. Ainslie had been ailing for some time and had been confined to the house for the past two months with pernicious anaemia. He was the last surviving&quot; member of Rixon, Ainslie &amp; Stoddart, which succeeded Maitland &amp; Rixon, and for several decades looked after their bush operations. The mill of Rixon, Ainslie &amp; Stoddart was in operation for about twenty years and sawed from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 feet of white and red pine a season. It has been closed about five years and was sold several months ago to Keenan Bros, of Owen Sound, Rixon, Ainslie &amp; Stoddart retaining certain limits. Mr. Ainslie was never married and leaves four nieces and two nephews to mourn his loss. He was an ardent athlete in his young'er days, playing with the cricket team of Owen Sound and winning the local championship in sculling contests, The funeral of Mr. Ainslie was largely attended, H. Mawson and S. R. Anderson, of the firm of Anderson, Shreiner &amp; Mawson, Toronto, were among the many who assembled to pay their last tri- bute of respect to a pioneer lumberman and a loyal, faithful citizen of Owen Sound. Another Veteran Lumberman Called Home George Benjamin Campbell, ex M.P.P., passed away recently at Bruce Mines, District of Algoma, Ont. He was the manager of the Fraser-Bryson Lumber Company's interests and was born in Eardley, Que., some seventy years ago. Mr. Campbell who was a former member of the Quebec Legislature for Pontiac County was a staunch Conservative, and in the last general election was a contest- ant for the Federal parliament in the same constituency, but was de- feated. In addition to his widow, Mr. Campbell is survived by three sons, Percy A., of Campbell's Bay, George Kenneth and Reginald Fraser of Eardley. Mr. Campbell was known as one of the most expert lumbermen in the Ottawa Valley. He also took an active interest in Masonry, being a 32nd degree Mason. In business, political and fraternal cir- cles he was highly esteemed, and many lumbermen took occasion to pay their last respects to him on the occasion of his funeral in- terment being in Quyon cemetry. The last sad rites were largely attended, the funeral being the most widely attended of any in the history of Pontiac County.<\/em>\n\n\n<strong>Note About Images<\/strong>\n<em>Please note that these images are extracted from scanned page images that may have been digitally enhanced for readability - coloration and appearance of these illustrations may not perfectly resemble the original work.<\/em>"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"Internet Archive Book Images","count_faves":"1","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5734\/20519665432_488ca6a9a6_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5734\/20519665432_488ca6a9a6_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5734\/20519665432_488ca6a9a6_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5734\/20519665432_488ca6a9a6_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5734\/20519665432_488ca6a9a6_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5734\/20519665432_488ca6a9a6_t.jpg","height_t":98,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5734\/20519665432_488ca6a9a6_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5734\/20519665432_488ca6a9a6_m.jpg","height_s":236,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5734\/20519665432_488ca6a9a6_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5734\/20519665432_488ca6a9a6_n.jpg","height_n":315,"width_n":320,"pathalias":"internetarchivebookimages"},{"id":"14593550867","owner":"126377022@N07","secret":"7d3d84601e","server":"5579","farm":6,"title":"Image from page 528 of \"The Boston blue book ... : containing ...

Each year, about 30,000 people in the United States die or suffer neurological damage from cerebral aneurysms, which form when a weak or thin region on a blood vessel in the brain bulges and fills with blood. If left untreated, an aneurysm can grow until it leaks or ruptures, spilling blood into the surrounding tissue and causing a hemorrhagic stroke. LLNL researchers are collaborating with colleagues from the University of California Davis Center for Biophotonics, Science and Technology and from UC Berkeley to develop safer, faster and more cost-effective treatments for patients with cerebral aneurysms. Using special shape-memorizing &quot;smart&quot; foams, the team developed an alternative treatment -- a &quot;plug&quot; that isolates an aneurysm from the rest of the vascular system. As the plug expands, it absorbs blood, which congeals and forms clots to stop blood flow inside the aneurysm. <a href=\"#\/\/www.llnl.gov\/str\/MaJune08\/maitland.html\u201d\">[More information]<\/a>

the first overseas service for the Light Horse. Tabulam's own Harry Chauvel was there. He served first as an officer with the 1st QMI contingent and again as the CO of the 7th Battalion Australian Commonwealth Horse. Christopher Mealing, Billy Mealing and Lou Hunter, at least three Tabulam men, enlisted in the Boer War.\nThe story of Tabulam's involvement with the Light Horse goes back to 1885, when the Chauvel's owned Tabulam Station. The old Captain, Charles Chauvel, had been an Indian Army man and, with the Russian scare in mind, he offered to raise a body of fit and able men to serve, if necessary, on the North West Frontier.\nThe result was that in October 1885, the two troops of the Upper Clarence Light Horse were formed, No 1 (Tabulam) and No 2 (The Border). On New Year's Day 1886, 129 men were sworn in and there was a banquet and great rejoicing in McLean's Tabulam Hotel that night. Along with the father, Captain Chauvel, the two sons, Arthur and Harry, were lieutenants and two younger sons joined as troopers. The troop also included four sons of George Smith of Drake; Jordans of Tabulam and Casino; four McAlister brothers; James McLean; Billy Craike (famous stockman on Tabulam Station) and his younger brother Charlie and young Alf Ravenscroft.\nThe first official duty of the new troops was to form a guard of honour - resplendent in the new full dress uniform of the day - at the opening of the Tenterfield Railway in February 1886.\nIn 1888, the Chauvel family left Tabulam for \u00d2Canning Downs South near Warwick, Qld. Harry Chauvel continued his military career which Tabulam people watched with interest. The Upper Clarence Light Horse continued to exist, with changes in Troop names and numbers dictated by the flow of population and availability of recruits. Harry Chauvel was now a Queenslander and formed and commanded the Warwick troop, including men from the Border Troop of the Upper Clarence Light Horse. Their first military duty was to assist the Police to keep order during the rioting and turmoil of the Great Shearer's and Barrier Miner's strikes of the 1890's. It is said that it was here that the tradition began of wearing the Emu feathers in the hat bands, which had so much tradition in the Light Horse regiments. Emu chasing on the western plains became a sport and naturally, the troopers stuck their trophies, the feathers, in their hats. It became so much a part of their dress that Queensland Troops were allowed to wear the feathers in their hats during the Boer War. Later, in 1915, the privilege was extended to all Light Horse Regiments.\nThe Boer War (1889-1902) was the first overseas service for the Light Horse. Tabulam's own Harry Chauvel was there. He served first as an officer with the 1st QMI contingent and again as the CO of the 7th Battalion Australian Commonwealth Horse. Christopher Mealing, Billy Mealing and lou Hunter, at least three Tabulam men, enlisted in the Boer War. They enlisted as State troops but returned as &quot;Commonwealth Military Forces&quot;, Federation having been achieved during their absence.\nThe Light Horse next served on Gallipoli as infantry and then fighting in Palestine during the desert campaign of 1916-17, under the command of the now General Harry Chauvel. Alf Ravenscroft, whose father, also Alf, was an original member of the Upper Clarence Light Horse, was General Chauvel's standard bearer during this campaign. Names like Magdhaba, Rafah, Gaza, Romani, El Arish and the famous charge of Beersheba, are a proud part of our history on account of the heroism of our Light Horsemen.\nDuring the post-war years, there was less activity on the part of Citizen's Military Forces. Perhaps old soldiers were sick of war and talk of war, after all, had they not fought a &quot;war to end all wars&quot;? - or so they thought. By the 1930's, however, there was a fresh stirring of interest, perhaps fostered by the ominous unrest in Europe.\nThe Tabulam troop was reformed in January 1931 and became part of the 15th Light Horse, Northern Rivers Lancers. The first parade was held on the same ground where Captain Charles Chauvel first enrolled the men of the Upper Clarence Light Horse, forty six years before. The then Lieutenant Harry Chauvel was now Hon. Colonel of the Regiment.\nThe early members of the new troop included Lionel Hewetson, Lt George Grey, Sgt and Troopers:-\nClarrie Mealing, Jack Hollis, Owen (Nugget) Winterton, Eric Wilkinson, Bevan Wilkinson, Eric Wilkinson (yes - two Eric Wilkinson\u00d5s), Charlie Coledus, Ernie Wright, Bill Ward, Jack Ward, Bill Poulson, Bert Wann, Jimm Wann and, slightly later, as they came of age, Cecil Keogh and Alex (Bill) Fraser.\nThis list was compiled with the aid of Mrs Jean Winterton of Tabulam. We apologise if it is incomplete but we are relying on our memories of sixty odd years ago.\nOne of the highlights for these boys and indeed for the whole district was the opening of the Grafton Bridge in July 1932. The 15th Light Horse provided escorts for Governor General Sir Isacc Isaacs during the opening of the bridge, an event in which one of our life members, Bob Smith, took part. Tabulam representatives for this event were W. (Bill) Ward, C. Mealing, W. (Bill) Poulson, Sgt. G. Grey, E. Wilkinson and J. Hollis (Photo). Monthly parades and annual camps were held regularly during the 1930's.\nIn 1938, the 15th Light Horse travelled to Sydney to take part in Australia's 150th Anniversary celebrations. The long train journey began at Casino and, after forty eight hours, reaching Darling Harbour at Sydney.\nWith other units, a total of four hundred men took part in the drills, part of which was to form the outline of Australia on the Sydney Show Ground. It was men from this camp who volunteered to stay behind and take part in the making of Charles Chauvel's (nephew of Sir Harry) film of &quot;Forty Thousand Horsemen&quot;, the saga of the famous desert campaign.\nIn March 1939, the Annual Camp was held in Grafton. It was their last peace time camp. The next camp, also in Grafton in November was held in a more serious atmosphere as World War II had been declared in September.\nBy January 1940, the Northern Light Horse Regiments were in camp in Armidale. This necessitated a long train journey from Murwillumbah Lismore Casino Grafton, horses and equipment had to be trucked to Maitland. Here horses were untrucked, watered fed and re-loaded on the Tableland line for Armidale.\nIt was from this camp that the majority of men enlisted for the A.I.F. as a Light Horse Unit. The camp contained 2,000 men and their horses and made a considerable impact upon the country town of Armidale.\nAnother year elapsed before another Light Horse camp was held. This time it was at Rutherford near Maitland. The 2,000 men of the 12th, 15th and 24th Light Horse Regiments were told that the Light Horse will always be a vital part of the defence of this country. How wrong can one be?\nIt was the last Light Horse camp to be held. Later that year, the men were told to hand in saddlery and equipment and dispose of their horses. The 15th Light Horse, born at Tabulam in 1885 was dead and, in its place was the 15th Motor Regiment, Armoured Division.\nIn October 1985, Tabulam celebrated the Centenary of the foundation of the Upper Clarence Light Horse. The 41st Battalion and the 1st\/15th Lancer Regiment from Parramatta, complete with military band, led a march through the town. The parade also included mounted ex-members of the old Light Horse Regiments, led by F. Shephard and B. Ravescroft (son of Gen Chauvel's standard bearer). Other members of the old Regiments marched and the Queensland Mounted Police and member of the 14th Light Horse Troop from Mudgeeraba, Queensland and colonial riders including a lady riding side-saddle, joined the parade.\nDuring the afternoon, a memorial was unveiled by Elyne Mitchell (daughter of Sir Harry Chauvel). The memorial features a base-relief of a Light Horseman, the work of Father John Casey of Mallanganee. It shows the names of those who enlisted from Tabulam and district for the 2 World Wars. Picnic tables and a flag pole were added.\nThe afternoon was then given over to sports of a military nature. Tent pegging, etc.. was demonstrated by the Qld Mounted Police and the Mudgeeraba unit. There were two showings of the film &quot;Forty Thousand Horsemen&quot; during the afternoon and a colonial Dance at night completed a really memorable day for Tabulam.\nWith all this Light Horse tradition behind Tabulam, it was surely fitting that seven ex-members of the 15th and 12th Light Horse were able to ride at the Tabulam Race Day on 11th November, 1995, the &quot;Australia Remembers&quot; year. Tabulam remembers the Light Horse."},"rotation":0,"ownername":"blokes 2012","count_faves":"0","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_t.jpg","height_t":75,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_m.jpg","height_s":180,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_n.jpg","height_n":240,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e.jpg","height_m":375,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_z.jpg","height_z":480,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_c.jpg","height_c":600,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4187\/34670081146_febcbd471e_b.jpg","height_l":768,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":null},{"id":"34579504011","owner":"82934060@N05","secret":"67944df52b","server":"4174","farm":5,"title":"Chauval House Tabulam Nsw","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"Tabulam and the Light Horse Tradition\nThe Boer War (1889-1902) was the first overseas service for the Light Horse.

The 15th Light Horse, born at Tabulam in 1885 was dead and, in its place was the 15th Motor Regiment, Armoured Division.\nIn October 1985, Tabulam celebrated the Centenary of the foundation of the Upper Clarence Light Horse. The 41st Battalion and the 1st\/15th Lancer Regiment from Parramatta, complete with military band, led a march through the town. The parade also included mounted ex-members of the old Light Horse Regiments, led by F. Shephard and B. Ravescroft (son of Gen Chauvel's standard bearer). Other members of the old Regiments marched and the Queensland Mounted Police and member of the 14th Light Horse Troop from Mudgeeraba, Queensland and colonial riders including a lady riding side-saddle, joined the parade.\nDuring the afternoon, a memorial was unveiled by Elyne Mitchell (daughter of Sir Harry Chauvel). The memorial features a base-relief of a Light Horseman, the work of Father John Casey of Mallanganee. It shows the names of those who enlisted from Tabulam and district for the 2 World Wars. Picnic tables and a flag pole were added.\nThe afternoon was then given over to sports of a military nature. Tent pegging, etc.. was demonstrated by the Qld Mounted Police and the Mudgeeraba unit. There were two showings of the film &quot;Forty Thousand Horsemen&quot; during the afternoon and a colonial Dance at night completed a really memorable day for Tabulam.\nWith all this Light Horse tradition behind Tabulam, it was surely fitting that seven ex-members of the 15th and 12th Light Horse were able to ride at the Tabulam Race Day on 11th November, 1995, the &quot;Australia Remembers&quot; year. Tabulam remembers the Light Horse."},"rotation":0,"ownername":"blokes 2012","count_faves":"0","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_t.jpg","height_t":75,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_m.jpg","height_s":180,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_n.jpg","height_n":240,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b.jpg","height_m":375,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_z.jpg","height_z":480,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_c.jpg","height_c":600,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/4174\/34579504011_67944df52b_b.jpg","height_l":768,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":null},{"id":"14595365459","owner":"126377022@N07","secret":"5b46f384e5","server":"5576","farm":6,"title":"Image from page 273 of \"Views in Edinburgh and its vicinity;\" (1820)","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":0,"license":"7","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"<b>Identifier<\/b>: viewsinedinburgh02stor\n<b>Title<\/b>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/internetarchivebookimages\/tags\/bookidviewsinedinburgh02stor\">Views in Edinburgh and its vicinity;<\/a>\n<b>Year<\/b>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/internetarchivebookimages\/tags\/bookyear1820\">1820<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/internetarchivebookimages\/tags\/bookdecade1820\">1820s<\/a>)\n<b>Authors<\/b>:  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/internetarchivebookimages\/tags\/bookauthorStorer__James__1771_1853\">Storer, James, 1771-1853<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/internetarchivebookimages\/tags\/bookauthorStorer__H__S___Henry_Sargant___1795_1837\">Storer, H.

The National Geographic Society has aided greatly in the advance- ment of civilization and in the discovery of many parts of the world and in the up- ward trend of this country. &quot;It has been first in the field of explora- tion and has aided greatly in the develop- ment of aviation. In the past, in explo- ration especially, it required years for achievements that may be made now in hours. In the future it is the hope of the aeronautical industry that the airplane will do its part in discovery and in bringing together and uniting more closely the na- tions. &quot;In closing, I want again to thank you.

The site of the manor and the farm called Stortford Pari; were held on a lease by Dr. William Stanley, the precentor of St. Paul's, at the beginning of the 18th century.^ After his death in 1827 the lease was sold, the premises then including 950 acres of land and quit-rents amounting to \u00c2\u00a313 1 3J,.fa The farm, which now belongs to Mr. F. Wilby, dates from about 1600 and is built of timber and plaster, which was refaced with brick in the 18th century. It is composed of a main block and two wings ; in the former is a square chimney stack with V-shaped pikster.. Stortford Castle was the head of the barony of the Bishop of London.9 The barony consisted of thirty-six and a third knights' fees lying in Hertford and Essex.10 The service, however, appears to have The bishop's feodary held courts leet throughout these lands.&quot; The places composing the bishop's liberty in Hertfordshire were Stortford, the two Hadhams, Albury, the three Pelhams, Meesden, Datchworth, Stevenage, Graveley and Chesfield. Castle-ward rents amounting to \u00c2\u00a3$ 15\/. 4^. were still payable from lands within these parishes when Salmon wrote (l 728). Sheriffs' warrants for execution within this area were directed to the bailiff of the liberty, who also had a right to strays and to toll of com and cattle in the markets and fairs.14 The manor of PI COTS, PIGGOTTS, PEKOTES or PICKETTS, lying in the south-west of the parish, was evidently formed by subinfeudation from the manor of Stortford, of which it was held by a castle- ward rent.1* A rental of Stortford of the late 1 3th century mentions ' tenementura Pycot' under the heading of North Street, but docs not give any addi-<\/em>\n\n<strong>Text Appearing After Image: <\/strong>\n<em>Back Vitw, Bishop's Stortford been commuted for twenty knights in the early 13th century,&quot; and by 1303 the whole barony is returned as responsible for the service of five fees only.1* A similar reduction is noticeable in the assess- ment of Richmond Honour, which fell from 140 fees to five.

(By Telegraph.\u2014Special to &quot;Star.&quot;)\nDetails of an accident in which Cecil Clive Middleton, single, aged 25, of New Brighton, lost his life, were investigated to-day by the coroner. The accident happened in Woolston at 10.25 p.m. on February 23. A motor cycle was ridden by Middleton, and in the side-chair was Traffic Inspector S. F. Napper, of the Heathcote County Council. The machine overtook two push-cyclists, and after the brakes had been applied, struck one cycle. The motor cycle was overturned, Inspector Napper and the rider of the cycle escaping unhurt.\n\nSydney Virtue, cyclist, described the collision, and said he afterwards saw two men lying on the road, and one of them, Napper, was bleeding at the nose. Witness noticed a strong smell of liquor. When he approached Middleton, who was writhing, he saw a broken bottle of beer on the road. It was a moonlight night and clear visibility. Veronica Brooks, a machinist, gave evidence that Napper smelt strongly of liquor. She was standing quite close to him, but he was not drunk.\n\nGeorge Fredrick Ward, a labourer, also gave evidence. There was a smell of liquor from Napper. Edward Henry Condon, another witness, said he did not notice a smell of liquor from Napper.

It is one of two mountain railways that run in Himachal Pradesh, the other being Kalka-Shimla Railway, which has been designated as World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Both of these currently run at a 762 mm narrow gauge, although they do not connect to each other. The Kangra Valley Railway is among in the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe railway line was planned in May 1926 and commissioned in 1929. The highest point on this line is at Ahju station at an elevation of 1,210 meters. The terminus at Joginder Nagar is at an elevation of 1,189 meters.\n\nA different alignment, a different mode of taking the railway through the maze of hills and valleys would have spoilt its picture postcard perfectness. This unique line has just two tunnels, one of which is only 250 feet and the other 1,000 feet in length. The traveler must remember this is a total distance of 103 miles. Instead of boring his way through the mountains, the railway engineer has skillfully avoided running head first into the hillside. Instead of following dizzy curves, he has cleverly chosen to avoid the awkward corners and straighten his turning. For the Kangra Valley Railway presents to the traveler, a chance to gaze as long as he likes on the ever present panorama of snow-clad ranges and the gold green fields without being swung round every few minutes on a narrow arc before his eyes can greet the scenery.\n\nCertainly the scenery through which the train passes is ample compensation for the extra distance covered as compared to getting there by road. The most picturesque parts of the valley are exposed to the view \u2013 the stretch of 18 miles from Mangwal to Kangra, for example, lies through country unsurpassed for its majestic grandeur with the majestic Ban Ganga gorge and the deep Kangra chasm as two piece de resistance. As one approaches Palampur, the ever present background of snowy chain peaks, 15,000 and 16,000 feet in height is barely ten miles away. From here onwards, the line runs parallel to the Dhauladhar range and much nearer to it than any other railways in India that ever comes so close to the eternal snows.\n______________________________________________\n\nINDIAN RAILWAYS\nIndian Railways (reporting mark IR) is an Indian state-owned enterprise, owned and operated by the Government of India through the Ministry of Railways. It is one of the world's largest railway networks comprising 115,000 km of track over a route of 65,808 km and 7,112 stations. In 2014-15, IR carried 8.397 billion passengers annually or more than 23 million passengers a day (roughly half of whom were suburban passengers) and 1058.81 million tons of freight in the year. On world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Railway Engines. In 2014\u20132015 Indian Railways had revenues of \u20b91634.50 billion (US$25 billion) which consists of \u20b91069.27 billion (US$16 billion) from freight and \u20b9402.80 billion (US$6.1 billion) from passengers tickets. \n\nRailways were first introduced to India in the year 1853 from Mumbai to Thane. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, the Indian Railways, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. IR operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a multi-gauge network of broad, metre and narrow gauges. It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities at several places in India and are assigned codes identifying their gauge, kind of power and type of operation. Its operations cover twenty nine states and seven union territories and also provides limited international services to Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Indian Railways is the world's seventh largest commercial or utility employer, by number of employees, with over 1.334 million employees as of last published figures in 2013. As for rolling stock, IR holds over 245,267 Freight Wagons, 66,392 Passenger Coaches and 10,499 Locomotives (43 steam, 5,633 diesel and 4,823 electric locomotives). The trains have a 5 digit numbering system and runs 12,617 passenger trains and 7421 freight trains daily. As of 31 March 2013, 21,614 km (32.8%) of the total 65,808 km route length was electrified. Since 1960, almost all electrified sections on IR use 25,000 Volt AC traction through overhead catenary delivery.\n\nHISTORY\nThe history of rail transport in India began in the mid-nineteenth century. The core of the pressure for building Railways In India came from London. In 1848, there was not a single kilometre of railway line in India. The country's first railway, built by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), opened in 1853, between Bombay and Thane. A British engineer, Robert Maitland Brereton, was responsible for the expansion of the railways from 1857 onwards. The Allahabad-Jabalpur branch line of the East Indian Railway had been opened in June 1867. Brereton was responsible for linking this with the GIPR, resulting in a combined network of 6,400 km. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. This route was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that &quot;it was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system&quot;.\n\nBy 1875, about \u00a395 million were invested by British companies in India. Guaranteed railways. By 1880 the network had a route mileage of about 14,500 km, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896, sent engineers and locomotives to help build the Uganda Railways.\n\nIn 1900, the GIPR became a government owned company. The network spread to the modern day states of Assam, Rajputhana and Madras Presidency and soon various autonomous kingdoms began to have their own rail systems. In 1905, an early Railway Board was constituted, but the powers were formally vested under Lord Curzon. It served under the Department of Commerce and Industry and had a government railway official serving as chairman, and a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways as the other two members. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a profit.\n\nIn 1907 almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government. The following year, the first electric locomotive made its appearance. With the arrival of World War I, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. With the end of the war, the railways were in a state of disrepair and collapse. Large scale corruption by British officials involved in the running of these railways companies was rampant. Profits were never reinvested in the development of British colonial India.\n\nIn 1920, with the network having expanded to 61,220 km, a need for central management was mooted by Sir William Acworth. Based on the East India Railway Committee chaired by Acworth, the government took over the management of the Railways and detached the finances of the Railways from other governmental revenues.\n\nThe period between 1920 and 1929, was a period of economic boom; there were 66,000 km of railway lines serving the country; the railways represented a capital value of some 687 million sterling; and they carried over 620 million passengers and approximately 90 million tons of goods each year. Following the Great Depression, the railways suffered economically for the next eight years. The Second World War severely crippled the railways. Starting 1939, about 40% of the rolling stock including locomotives and coaches was taken to the Middle East, the railways workshops were converted to ammunitions workshops and many railway tracks were dismantled to help the Allies in the war. By 1946, all rail systems had been taken over by the government.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nRAILWAY ZONES\nIndian Railways is divided into 16 zones, which are further sub-divided into divisions. The number of zones in Indian Railways increased from six to eight in 1951, nine in 1966 and seventeen in 2003. Each zonal railway is made up of a certain number of divisions, each having a divisional headquarters. There are a total of sixty-eight divisions.\n\nEach zone is headed by a general manager, who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions, under the control of divisional railway managers (DRM). The divisional officers, of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal and telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial, security and safety branches, report to the respective Divisional Railway Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the station masters, who control individual stations and train movements through the track territory under their stations' administration.\n\nRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING\nStaff are classified into gazetted (Group 'A' and 'B') and non-gazetted (Group 'C' and 'D') employees. The recruitment of Group 'A' gazetted employees is carried out by the Union Public Service Commission through exams conducted by it. The recruitment to Group 'C' and 'D' employees on the Indian Railways is done through 20 Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells which are controlled by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB). The training of all cadres is entrusted and shared between six centralised training institutes.\n\nROLLING STOCK\nLOCOMOTIVES\nLocomotives in India consist of electric and diesel locomotives. The world's first CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) locomotives are also being used. Steam locomotives are no longer used, except in heritage trains. In India, locomotives are classified according to their track gauge, motive power, the work they are suited for and their power or model number. The class name includes this information about the locomotive. It comprises 4 or 5 letters. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes their motive power (Diesel or Alternating - on Electric) and the third letter denotes the kind of traffic for which they are suited (goods, passenger, Multi or shunting). The fourth letter used to denote locomotives' chronological model number. However, from 2002 a new classification scheme has been adopted. Under this system, for newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter will denote their horsepower range. Electric locomotives don't come under this scheme and even all diesel locos are not covered. For them this letter denotes their model number as usual.In world level Ghaziabad is the largest manufacturer of Locomotive.\n\nA locomotive may sometimes have a fifth letter in its name which generally denotes a technical variant or subclass or subtype. This fifth letter indicates some smaller variation in the basic model or series, perhaps different motors, or a different manufacturer. With the new scheme for classifying diesel locomotives (as mentioned above) the fifth item is a letter that further refines the horsepower indication in 100 hp increments: 'A' for 100 hp, 'B' for 200 hp, 'C' for 300 hp, etc. So in this scheme, a WDM-3A refers to a 3100 hp loco, while a WDM-3D would be a 3400 hp loco and WDM-3F would be 3600 hp loco.\n\nNote: This classification system does not apply to steam locomotives in India as they have become non-functional now. They retained their original class names such as M class or WP class.\n\nDiesel Locomotives are now fitted with Auxiliary Power Units which saves nearly 88% of Fuel during the idle time when train is not running.\n\nGOODS WAGONS\nThe number of goods wagons was 205,596 on 31 March 1951 and reached the maximum number 405,183 on 31 March 1980 after which it started declining and was 239,321 on 31 March 2012. The number is far less than the requirement and the Indian Railways keeps losing freight traffic to road. Indian Railways carried 93 million tonnes of goods in 1950\u201351 and it increased to 1010 million tonnes in 2012\u201313.\n\nHowever, its share in goods traffic is much lower than road traffic. In 1951, its share was 65% and the share of road was 35%. Now the shares have been reversed and the share of railways has declined to 30% and the share of road has increased to 70%.\n\nPASSENGER COACHES\nIndian railways has several types of passenger coaches.\n\nElectric Multiple Unit (EMU) coaches are used for suburban traffic in large cities \u2013 mainly Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These coaches numbered 7,793 on 31 March 2012. They have second class and first class seating accommodation.\n\nThe coaches used in Indian Railways are produced at Integral Coach Factory, Rail Coach Factory.Now,they are producing new LHB coaches.\n\nPassenger coaches numbered 46,722 on 31 March 2012. Other coaches (luggage coach, parcel van, guard's coach, mail coach, etc.) numbered 6,560 on 31 March 2012.\n\nFREIGHT\nIndian Railways earns about 70% of its revenues from freight traffic (\u20b9686.2 billion from freight and \u20b9304.6 billion from passengers in 2011\u201312). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this makes up for losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.\n\nSince the 1990s, Indian Railways has stopped single-wagon consignments and provides only full rake freight trains\n\nWagon types include:\n\n    BOXNHL\n    BOBYN\n    BCN\n    BCNHL\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nTRACK AND GAUGE\nIndian railways uses four gauges, the 1,676 mm broad gauge which is wider than the 1,435 mm standard gauge; the 1,000 mm metre gauge; and two narrow gauges, 762 mm and 610 mm. Track sections are rated for speeds ranging from 75 to 160 km\/h.\n\nThe total length of track used by Indian Railways is about 115,000 km while the total route length of the network is 65,000 km. About 24,891 km or 38% of the route-kilometre was electrified, as of 31 March 2014.\n\nBroad gauge is the predominant gauge used by Indian Railways. Indian broad gauge - 1,676 mm - is the most widely used gauge in India with 108,500 km of track length (94% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 59,400 km of route-kilometre (91% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nIn some regions with less traffic, the metre gauge (1,000 mm) is common, although the Unigauge project is in progress to convert all tracks to broad gauge. The metre gauge has about 5,000 km of track length (4% of entire track length of all the gauges) and 4,100 km of route-kilometre (7% of entire route-kilometre of all the gauges).\n\nThe Narrow gauges are present on a few routes, lying in hilly terrains and in some erstwhile private railways (on cost considerations), which are usually difficult to convert to broad gauge. Narrow gauges have 1,500 route-kilometre. The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway are three notable hill lines that use narrow gauge, but the Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a metre gauge track. These four rail lines will not be converted under the Unigauge project.\n\nThe share of broad gauge in the total route-kilometre has been steadily rising, increasing from 47% (25,258 route-km) in 1951 to 86% in 2012 whereas the share of metre gauge has declined from 45% (24,185 route-km) to 10% in the same period and the share of narrow gauges has decreased from 8% to 3%. About 24,891 route-km of Indian railways is electrified.\n\nSleepers (ties) are made up of prestressed concrete, or steel or cast iron posts, though teak sleepers are still in use on a few older lines. The prestressed concrete sleeper is in wide use today. Metal sleepers were extensively used before the advent of concrete sleepers. Indian Railways divides the country into four zones on the basis of the range of track temperature. The greatest temperature variations occur in Rajasthan.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nIndian Railways has a full-fledged organisation known as Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), located at Lucknow for all research, designs and standardisation tasks.\n\nIn August 2013, Indian Railways entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) to develop technology to tap solar energy for lighting and air-conditioning in the coaches. This would significantly reduce the fossil fuel dependency for Indian Railways.\n\nRecently it developed and tested the Improved Automated Fire Alarm System in Rajdhani Express Trains. It is intended that the system be applied to AC coaches of all regular trains.\n\nCURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nIn recent years, Indian Railways has undertaken several initiatives to upgrade its ageing infrastructure and enhance its quality of service. The Indian government plans to invest \u20b9905000 crore (US$137 billion) to upgrade the railways by 2020.\n\nTOILETS ON RAILWAYS\nIn 2014, Indian Railways and DRDO developed a bio-toilet to replace direct-discharge toilets, which are currently the primary type of toilet used in railway coaches. The direct discharge of human waste from trains onto the tracks corrodes rails, costing Indian Railways tens of millions of rupees a year in rail-replacement work. Flushing a bio-toilet discharges human waste into an underfloor holding tank where anaerobic bacteria remove harmful pathogens and break the waste down into neutral water and methane. These harmless by-products can then be safely discharged onto the tracks without causing corrosion or foul odours. As part of its &quot;Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat&quot; (&quot;Clean Rail-Clean India&quot;) programme, Indian Railways plans to completely phase out direct-discharge toilets on its lines by 2020-2021. As of March 2015, 17,338 bio-toilets had been installed on newly built coaches, with all new coaches to have bio-toilets from 2016; older rolling stock will be retrofitted.\n\nLOCOMOTIVE FACTORIES\nIn 2015, plans were disclosed for building two locomotive factories in the state of Bihar, at Madhepura (diesel locomotives) and at Marhowra (electric locomotives). Both factories involve foreign partnerships. The diesel locomotive works will be jointly operated in a partnership with General Electric, which has invested \u20b92052 crore (US$310 million) for its construction, and the electric locomotive works with Alstom, which has invested \u20b91293.57 crore (US$195 million). The factories will provide Indian Railways with 800 electric locomotives of 12,000 horse power each, and a mix of 1,000 diesel locomotives of 4,500 and 6,000 horsepower each. In November 2015, further details of the \u20b914656 crore (US$2 billion) partnership with GE were announced: Indian Railways and GE would engage in an 11-year joint venture in which GE would hold a majority stake of 74%. Under the terms of the joint venture, Indian Railways would purchase 100 goods locomotives a year for 10 years beginning in 2017; the locomotives would be modified versions of the GE Evolution series. The diesel locomotive works will be built by 2018; GE will import the first 100 locomotives and manufacture the remaining 900 in India from 2019, also assuming responsibility for their maintenance over a 13-year period. In the same month, a \u20b920000 crore (US$3 billion) partnership with Alstom to supply 800 electric locomotives from 2018 to 2028 was announced.\n\nLINKS TO ADJACENT COUNTRIES\nEXISTING RAIL LINKS\nNepal \u2013 Break-of-gauge \u2013 Gauge conversion under uni-gauge project\nPakistan \u2013 same Broad Gauge.

A second passenger link between Agartala, India and Akhaura Upazila, Bangladesh was approved by the Government of Bangladesh and India in September 2011.\n\nUNDER CONSTRUCTUION \/ PROPOSED LINKS \nBhutan \u2013 railways under construction \u2013 Same gauge\nMyanmar \u2013 Manipur to Myanmar (under construction)\nVietnam \u2013 On 9 April 2010, Former Union Minister of India, Shashi Tharoor announced that the central government is considering a rail link from Manipur to Vietnam via Myanmar.\nThailand \u2013 possible if Burma Railway is rebuilt.\n\nTYPES OF PASSENGER SERVICES\nTrains are classified by their average speed. A faster train has fewer stops (&quot;halts&quot;) than a slower one and usually caters to long-distance travel.\n\nACCOMODATION CLASSES\nIndian Railways has several classes of travel with or without airconditioning. A train may have just one or many classes of travel. Slow passenger trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, garib rath and yuva trains have only airconditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train but the fare for other trains does not include food that has to be bought separately. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.\n\nA standard passenger rake generally has four unreserved (also called &quot;general&quot;) compartments, two at the front and two at the end, of which one may be exclusively for ladies. The exact number of other coaches varies according to the demand and the route. A luggage compartment can also exist at the front or the back. In some mail trains a separate mail coach is attached. Lavatories are communal and feature both the Indian style as well as the Western style.\n\nThe following table lists the classes in operation. A train may not have all these classes.\n\n1A First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\n2A AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.\n\nFC First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.\n\n3A AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.\n\n3E AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains. Berths are usually arranged as in 3AC but with three tiers across the width and three longways. They are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included with fare.\n\nCC AC chair car: An air-conditioned seater coach with a total of five seats in a row used for day travel between cities.\n\nEC Executive class chair car: An air-conditioned coach with large spacious seats and legroom. It has a total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on Shatabdi Express trains.\n\nSL Sleeper class: The sleeper class is the most common coach on IR, and usually ten or more coaches could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.\n\n2S Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance or may be unreserved.\n\nUR Unreserved: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours of buying the ticket.\n\nAt the rear of the train is a special compartment known as the guard's cabin. It is fitted with a transceiver and is where the guard usually gives the all clear signal before the train departs.\n\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Indian Railways. \u2013 The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Mountain Railways of India. The latter consists of three separate railway lines located in different parts of India:\n\n- Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow gauge railway in West Bengal.\n- Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu.\n- Kalka-Shimla Railway, a narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh. In 2003 the railway was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for offering the steepest rise in altitude in the space of 96 kilometre.\n\nNOTABLE TRAINS\nTOURIST TRAINS\nPalace on Wheels is a specially designed luxury tourist train service, frequently hauled by a steam locomotive, for promoting tourism in Rajasthan.

On 16 April 2013, Indian Railways celebrated its 160 years of nationwide connectivity with a transportation of 23 million passengers in a day.\n\nPROBLEMS AND ISSUES\nIndian Railways is cash strapped and reported a loss of \u20b930,000 crores (\u20b9300bn) in the passenger segment for the year ending March 2014. Operating ratio, a key metric used by Indian railways to gauge financial health, is 91.8% in the year 2014-15. Railways carry a social obligation of over \u20b920,000 crores (\u20b9200bn $3.5bn). The loss per passenger-km increased to 23 paise by the end of March 2014. Indian Railways is left with a surplus cash of just \u20b9690 crores (\u20b96.9bn $115mn) by the end of March 2014.\n\nIt is estimated that over \u20b9 5 lakh crores (\u20b95 trillion) (about $85 bn at 2014 exchange rates) is required to complete the ongoing projects alone. The railway is consistently losing market share to other modes of transport both in freight and passengers.\n\nNew railway line projects are often announced during the Railway Budget annually without securing additional funding for them. In the last 10 years, 99 New Line projects worth \u20b9 60,000 crore (\u20b9600bn) were sanctioned out of which only one project is complete till date, and there are four projects that are as old as 30 years, but are still not complete for one reason or another.\n\nSanjay Dina Patil a member of the Lok Sabha in 2014 said that additional tracks, height of platforms are still a problem and rise in tickets, goods, monthly passes has created an alarming situation where the common man is troubled.\n\nWIKIPEDIA"},"rotation":0,"ownername":"asienman","realname":"Manfred Sommer","count_faves":"4","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_t.jpg","height_t":56,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_m.jpg","height_s":135,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_n.jpg","height_n":180,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d.jpg","height_m":281,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_z.jpg","height_z":360,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_c.jpg","height_c":450,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/5587\/14496205772_3be2ff879d_b.jpg","height_l":576,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"asienman"},{"id":"26692917580","owner":"20654194@N07","secret":"3ebb775f8e","server":"7038","farm":8,"title":"TV Shows We Used To Watch - Brookside C4","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":1,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"How much do you remember about Brookside? \n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fm0CJtVSQD8\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fm0CJtVSQD8<\/a>\n\nBrookside is a British soap opera set in Liverpool, England. The series began on the launch night of Channel 4 on 2 November 1982, and ran for 21 years until 4 November 2003. Originally intended to be called Meadowcroft, the series was produced by Mersey Television and it was conceived by Phil Redmond who also devised Grange Hill (1978\u20132008) and Hollyoaks (1995\u2013present).\n\nBrookside became very successful and was often Channel 4's highest rated programme for a number of years in the 1980s and early 1990s, with audiences regularly in excess of 8 million viewers. It is notable for its tackling of realistic and socially challenging storylines. From the mid-1990s it began raising more controversial subjects under the guidance of new producers such as Mal Young and Paul Marquess. It is especially well known for broadcasting the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss on British television in 1994, as well as a powerful domestic abuse storyline resulting in murder. In 1996, the series caused an uproar when it featured a storyline of a consensual incestuous sexual relationship between two sibling characters. \n\nBrookside was also the first British soap to feature an openly gay character when Gordon Collins came out in 1985, and it was also the first to depict serious drug addiction with a number of different characters. Although the series had a long and successful run, by 2000 its viewing figures were in terminal decline and low ratings eventually led to its cancellation in 2003.\n\nThe final episode was broadcast on 4 November 2003 and was watched by around 2 million viewers.\n\nThe first episode of Brookside was repeated as part of Channel 4 at 25 on 1 October 2007. The episode aired on More4 in a season of celebratory Channel 4 programmes to mark the channel's first quarter century. Several classic episodes have also been available to view on 4oD, an online service, since 2009.\n\nAfter years of campaigning by fans, a special DVD was released in November 2012, just over 30 years after the series originally began, titled Brookside Most Memorable Moments. It features clips and episodes from every year of the programme's 21-year history.\n\nBrookside differed from other soap operas because it was filmed in real, brand-new houses, in a real cul-de-sac, situated off Deysbrook Lane in the North West city of Liverpool.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7MvrrA7zv8s&amp;list=PLHkDX58c6v3XDpa0OLm5M9ZlfHMfwo78s\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7MvrrA7zv8s&amp;list=PLHkDX58c6v3...<\/a>\n\nBuilt by Broseley Homes, the houses were custom built in an attempt by the producers to add to the show's realism. In early 1982, Mersey Television, with Phil Redmond at the helm, bought thirteen houses altogether, six of which would be seen on-screen as sets. The remaining seven properties housed administration, postproduction and canteen facilities for the cast and crew. Phil Redmond was particularly enthusiastic about purchasing an entire 'close' of houses, partly as a means of achieving the desired realism of Brookside, but also in order to maintain total control of his creation.\n\n<b>The Body Under the Patio plot<\/b>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uT5T5mBg2BU\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uT5T5mBg2BU<\/a>\n\nOne of Brookside's most famous storyline began in February 1993, with the story of wife beater and child abuser Trevor Jordache (Bryan Murray). His wife, Mandy (Sandra Maitland) and daughters Beth (Anna Friel) and Rachel (Tiffany Chapman) moved into number 10 under a shroud of mystery. \n\nThe house had been vacated by the remaining Corkhill clan and sold to a Mrs Shackleton; however, unbeknown to the residents of the close, she was acting as a representative for a charity supporting abused families, and had purchased the property as a safe house. After the Jordache family moved in some disturbing facts began to emerge. It transpired that not only had Mandy suffered years of mental and physical abuse, but also that Beth had been sexually abused by her father. Before long Trevor, who had recently been released from prison for GBH against Mandy, found them in Brookside Close. He persuaded Mandy to let him back into the family home pretending to have been changed by prison, but once in he quickly resumed his own ways, frequently beating Mandy. \n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z5KMN_7k1rI\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z5KMN_7k1rI<\/a>\n\nThings quickly escalated as Trevor began getting violent towards Beth also and began sexually abusing Rachel. As the abuse and torture got worse, Beth encouraged her mother Mandy to plot to kill Trevor. After several attempts by the pair to poison him failed, Mandy and Beth stabbed him in the kitchen of number 10 and, with the help of Sinbad, buried him underneath their patio, where his body remained until January 1995, when neighbour Eddie Banks (Paul Broughton) dug him up whilst investigating a leaking water pipe. Following the discovery, Sinbad, who had genuine feelings towards Mandy and had been totally supportive and sympathetic of her plight, took the family on the run to the Republic of Ireland. \n\nThis was depicted in a couple of episodes before they were arrested in Dublin as wanted suspects for murder. Subsequently, on return to Britain, Mandy and Beth were immediately charged with Trevor's murder, launching the Free the Jordache Two campaign and ratings soared with Brookside achieving its highest ever viewing figures of 9 million. The story was inspired by a real life case in Walsall, West Midlands, where a woman killed her abusive husband and buried his body under the patio of their house in 1990; it was discovered two years later.\n\nWhen there\u2019s a knock on the door, Lee Carroll knows exactly what it will be for.\n\nAnd, chances are, it won\u2019t be a neighbour calling for a chat but an excited fan wanting to look at his patio!\n\n\u201cI get at least one person a fortnight knocking at the door, asking to come in and looking around my house,\u201d says Lee. \u201cAnd they always want to go in my garden...\u201d\n\nFor Lee, 32, is resident of what used to be one of Merseyside\u2019s most famous addresses, Number 10 Brookside Close.\n\nFormer \u2018home\u2019 of the Corkhills, it was also the scene of what soap viewers voted one of the most dramatics story lines ever: the body under the patio.\n\nWife beater and child abuser Trevor Jordache (Bryan Murray) lay undetected there for two years before his body was discovered 20 years ago this month, in hit Mersey TV soap Brookside.\n\n<b>The last episode<\/b>\n\nIn the extended final episode, screened at 22:40 and divided into three distinct parts, Brookside shocked the audience one last time with the remaining residents of Brookside Close taking a stand against Michaelson, lynching him from number 8's bedroom window.\n\nWritten by creator Phil Redmond, the final episode started exactly the same way episode one had begun 21 years previously, with a milkman delivering provisions to the residents of the Close. This time, however, he was greeted with the sight of Jack Michaelson's dead body hanging from his bedroom window. When the police started investigating, all of the residents on Brookside Close gave false alibis, thus protecting each other from prosecution over Michaelson's murder. As had been seen in Brookside before, the culprits of the lynching were not revealed, with several characters seen to have the same blue rope with which Michaelson was hanged. Encouraged by the return of Barry Grant, Tim, Steve, and the remaining Gordon lads were all seen contemplating killing Michaelson, and whilst Jimmy was also aware there was a plan, the only male resident in ignorance of what was happening was Ron Dixon. During the darkness of the night, three masked residents broke into Michaelson's house and suspended him from the front window, however, this is all that was revealed to the audience.\n\nIn the last part of the episode, Phil Redmond had his final say in a rebellious scripted rant criticising religion, urban migration, public ignorance and the prohibition of drugs, which was voiced by Brookside's longest-running character, Jimmy Corkhill, sat in an armchair on the front lawn of number 10. Jimmy was also the last resident of Brookside Close to leave their house. As a last act of defiance, he broke into the abandoned houses and left all the taps running, he then painted Game Over on the boarded-up windows of several houses, and drew an extra D on the Brookside Close sign, to spell Brookside Closed at the end of the episode. He then went to live with his daughter Lindsey, who had married Barry Grant off-screen, the two characters having returned especially for the final episode, watched by a peak of 2.27 million viewers.\n\nIn the closing narrative, Jimmy and Lindsey went to live in Newcastle in Barry's mansion. Tim moved in with Steve Murray, sharing a flat in Liverpool City Centre, as shown in the Unfinished Business feature. Nikki left for Brussels to live with her mother Margi. The orphaned Gordon children then left with their elder sister Ruth, and her husband Sean Smith, now reunited as head of the remaining Gordon family. Jan, Marty and Anthony Murray followed soon after, refusing to tell anyone where they were going.

It takes six 10-hour days to make three episodes.\n\nBrookside employs three gardeners to ensure that the plants and flowers seen in episodes are correct for the time of year they are broadcast.\n\nAll the Close's houses have actual hot and cold running water, and fully-functioning central heating, fridges, cookers and washing machines.\n\nThe deaths of Matthew and Emily Farnham came about because producers wanted a surrogacy storyline.\n\nThe role of Fee Phelan, eventually taken by Jackie Downey, was meant to be played by Cheryl Murray, Corrie's Suzie Birchall.\n\nPhil Redmond bought the original nine houses in Brookside Close for \u00a325,000 each.\n\nLetitia Dean and Malandra Burrows had minor roles in Brookside before finding greater soap fame in Eastenders and Emmerdale respectively.\n\nAndrew Fillis, who played Lindsey Corkhill's abusive husband Gary Stanlow, originally auditioned for the role of Carl Banks.\n\nPaul Usher (Barry Grant) was a Bluecoat at Pontins.\n\nThe late Gladys Ambrose, who played Julia Brogan, previously appeared in a comedy acrobatic act alongside her husband Johannes.\n\nThree different versions of the murder of Sue and Danny Sullivan were filmed in 1991, with Barry Grant, Terry Sullivan and Graeme Curtis each seen pushing them off scaffolding.\n\nCarol Connor who played Carmel O'Leary, is the sister of singer Sonia and sang backing vocals when she competed in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1993.\n\nPhil Redmond's determination to keep Brookside realistic caused uproar when early episodes had characters swearing.

The scene used a real-life mother and baby for the shots and was the first time a soap had broken the taboo.\n\nThe British Meningitis Trust commended the programme in 1990 for the thoroughness of its research in the storyline where Danny Sullivan contracted the illness.\n\nThere have been two crossover plots between Brookside and fellow Mersey Television show Hollyoaks: Jacqui and Katie saw actors from the latter in Chester 1998, while Jessie Shadwick and Alec O'Brien popped into the Hollyoaks pub The Dog In The Pond for a swift half in May 1999.\n\nFormer Neighbours and Home and Away star Richard Norton appeared in 1995 as a fictional Aussie soap star called Shane Cochran, who died after taking heroin sold to him by Gary Stanlow.\n\nWhen Laura Gordon-Davies was electrocuted in 1987, she was in a coma for three months - the producers' revenge on actress Jane Cunliffe, who caused them problems by quitting the show.\n\nBryan Murray, who was well-known for his comedy roles such as Shifty in the sitcom Bread, was deliberately cast as evil Trevor Jordache to fool people into thinking he was a nice character.\n\nHarry Cross was originally meant to die from a heart attack after three months, but the character was so popular that he stayed for five years.\n\nEileen O'Brien, who played Mick's terminally ill mother-in-law Gladys Charlton, was previously punk Mary Smith's mother in Eastenders.\n\nWhen Paul Usher (Barry Grant) left the show suddenly in 1993, scripts had to be hastily rewritten. Most of his dialogue was given to Mick, while a disembodied hand was seen packing a suitcase.\n\nAward-winning writer Jimmy McGovern, famous for Cracker, Hillsborough and The Lakes, wrote some of Brooksides early episodes.\n\nTricia Penrose, who plays barmaid Gina Ward in Heartbeat, appeared in 1988 as Emma Reid, a WPC with whom Rod Corkhill had a steamy affair.\n\nSuzanne Packer, who played Mick Johnson's errant wife Josie, is the sister of Olympic hurdler Colin Jackson.\n\nRicky Tomlinson (Bobby Grant) was once in a country and western band alongside future co-star Tony Scoggo, who played Bobby's best friend Matty Nolan.\n\nThe entire Collins family had to be written out in 1990 when Doreen Sloane, who played matriarch Annabelle, tragically died of cancer."},"rotation":0,"ownername":"brizzle born and bred","realname":"Paul Townsend","count_faves":"1","count_comments":"0","can_comment":1,"permissions":{"permcomment":3},"isfavorite":0,"media":"photo","media_status":"ready","url_sq":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_s.jpg","url_sq_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_s.jpg","height_sq":75,"width_sq":75,"url_q":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_q.jpg","url_q_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_q.jpg","height_q":150,"width_q":150,"url_t":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_t.jpg","url_t_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_t.jpg","height_t":52,"width_t":100,"url_s":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_m.jpg","url_s_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_m.jpg","height_s":125,"width_s":240,"url_n":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_n.jpg","url_n_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_n.jpg","height_n":167,"width_n":320,"url_m":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e.jpg","url_m_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e.jpg","height_m":261,"width_m":500,"url_z":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_z.jpg","url_z_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_z.jpg","height_z":334,"width_z":640,"url_c":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_c.jpg","url_c_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_c.jpg","height_c":418,"width_c":800,"url_l":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_b.jpg","url_l_cdn":"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7038\/26692917580_3ebb775f8e_b.jpg","height_l":535,"width_l":1024,"pathalias":"brizzlebornandbred"},{"id":"4254393439","owner":"53381278@N00","secret":"c806ed448a","server":"4056","farm":5,"title":"James Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie","ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0,"safe":0,"license":"0","needs_interstitial":0,"description":{"_content":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YpjSUhHgBOI\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YpjSUhHgBOI<\/a>\n\nJames Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie (23 September 1784 \u2013 24 September 1843), was a British politician and British colonial administrator.

Cunningham found a gap in the dividing range, and the following year, while visiting Moreton Bay, he found a gap which he thought was the same one he had discovered previously, and which became known as Cunningham's Gap.[1]\n\nThis open country had been carefully and deliberately maintained by the Aborigines in what has been called firestick farming, an annual pattern of controlled burns to protect certain resource areas and pasture for native grazing animals. The Aboriginal burning pattern was disrupted within the first years of the runs being taken up, and the local Aboriginal population were soon killed off.[1]\n\nThe unsettled districts outside the nineteen counties around Sydney had been thrown open to squatters by the 1836 licence system. This system proved ineffective and in 1839 a new Act was passed. This Act provided for an annual licence fee to be paid, determined per head of stock on the run, and also provided administration by Commissioners of Crown Lands. However, the squatters still had no permanency of land tenure, and in 1847 Orders in Council were introduced which allowed further 14 year leases for established unsettled runs on payment of an annual fee per head of stock. The Orders in Council also gave the run holders the pre-emptive right to purchase the land for its fair value in an unimproved state at less than one pound per acre at the completion of the lease. Pre-emption was allowed to continue until 1868, and meant that nearly all the best land, creek frontages, water holes and portions guarding leasehold areas were pre-empted. It allowed the squatters to hold onto their land, but also plunged many of them into debt often resulting in financial ruin.[1]\n\nPatrick Leslie (1815-1881) born at Warthill, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the second son of William Leslie, ninth laird of Warthill and eight of Folla, had sailed from London in 1834 and arrived in New South Wales in May 1835. He gained pastoralist experience under the Macarthurs of Camden, and in 1836 went to manage the property of his uncle Davidson on the Krui River at Colleroi. By 1839 Leslie had rented Dunheved farm at Penrith, and when his brothers Walter and George arrived he decided to look for new land north of the limits of settlement. In 1840 he started with a large party for the Clarence River district, and then resolved to look at the Darling Downs. With one companion, a convict named Murphy, he followed Cunningham's trail and relocated the Darling Downs and decided on the area that was to become Toolburra and Canning Downs for his first station. Walter Leslie and Ernest Dalrymple followed with the flocks, and in 1840 the Leslies became the first settlers on the Darling Downs.[1]\n\nErnest Dalrymple took up a run next to the Leslies, and all runs on the Downs were taken up by June 1841. The Leslies originally selected all the land which became Toolburra, South Toolburra, Glengallan, Gladfield, Maryvale, Warwick and Canning Downs, and had taken up a far greater area than which they were entitled under a New South Wales licence. They had to dispose of the areas that became Glengallan, Sandy Creek, and Fred (Bracker) the German's Creek (Rosenthal) to the Aberdeen Company.[1]\n\nThe Leslies negotiated permission to bring supplies from the Moreton Bay settlement, even though it was not open to commerce. The settlement opened in 1842 however, and thereafter all the Downs squatters (run holders) were free to have supplies sent in and wool sent out to Ipswich, from where they could be transported by river to Brisbane.[1]\n\nIn 1841-42 the Leslie brothers sold approximately 42,000 acres (17,000 ha) to brothers Colin and John Campbell, Scottish immigrants, who named it Glengallan Run. The Leslies noted they had disposed of the buildings and the right of the lower part of the run for which they had no use and they had received \u00a3250 for it. This description may have included Glengallan, Fred the German's Creek and Sandy Creek.[1]\n\nBy 1844, Campbell and Co were in liquidation, but the partnership recovered and after 1844 it appears that licences for Glengallan were issued in the sole name of Colin Campbell. Another brother, Archibald, managed the property from 1845\u201348 and during this time the stock numbers increased considerably, but disease broke out in 1847. Glengallan was offered for sale in November 1847, but this was not successful.[1]\n\nThe Campbell's first encampment had been at Freestone Creek, an area which has become known as Campbell Plains, but it proved unsuitable for sheep due to wooded areas and dingo habitat. The camp subsequently moved to Glengallan Creek, known as Gap Creek, near the slope of what became Mt Marshall. It has been suggested that their c.1842 residence, described as a rude but substantial hut, would have been close to the site of the present homestead being close to the creek but above flood level, with expansive views of the surrounding area and a relatively flat terrace of land, but the exact location has not been positively identified. The 1846 diary of the New South Wales Commissioner for Crown Lands, Darling Downs District, stated the run was 120 square miles with 15,000 head of sheep, 400 cattle and 30 horses. In 1848, a NSW Government Gazette noted Colin Campbell holding leases for Glengallan totalling 60,000 acres (24,000 ha). Glengallan was located in a pivotal position on the main roads, which have changed slightly in position, from Toowoomba\/Drayton heading towards the south and from the Downs properties heading towards Cunningham's Gap.[1]\n\nThe NSW Government Gazette published a list of transfers of runs dated 11 October 1848 recording the transfer of Glengallan from Colin Campbell to the unrelated Robert Tertius Campbell (1811-1887) with whom Colin Campbell banked, and it appears that the three Campbell brothers died in 1853. Robert Tertius Campbell, whose father was a Director of the Bank of New South Wales, was related to the Campbells of Duntroon in the Monaro district, and had been lessee of Jondaryan in 1845, gained the lease of North Branch of Swamps Run in 1849, and continued leasing Canning Creek until 1852. The NSW Government Gazette dated 30 July 1852 recorded that RT Campbell transferred his interest in Glengallan to his partner Charles Henry Marshall, who had previously been his managing clerk and whom he took into partnership in Glengallan it appears in 1849-50. RT Campbell then moved on to the newly opened Burnett District.[1]\n\nIn December 1851 and March 1852, the artist Conrad Martens (1801-1878), who had arrived in Sydney in 1835, stayed at Glengallan during the course of his five-month trip to the Brisbane area and the Darling Downs in search of painting commissions. He travelled through the country making pencil drawings, many of which he used as the basis for water colours and oil paintings, which he executed on his return to Sydney. These drawings and paintings are some of the few illustrations of Queensland during this time, and his sketches of Glengallan show the main homestead as two timber buildings surrounded by verandahs and situated close together.[1]\n\nCharles Henry Marshall (1818-1874) was born in Mauritius and had a background in Leith in Scotland and Totnes in Devon, England. He came to Australia in 1842[2] as Bookkeeper for the Van Diemen's Land Company at Circular Head (Stanley) and was Superintendent of the company's Woolnorth Station at Cape Grim from 1846 to 1849 after which he moved to Queensland. He was appointed Magistrate in 1849-50 and took John Deuchar into partnership in 1855. Marshall was an active member of the Church of England, and in 1858 gave 11 acres (4.5 ha) of land in Warwick to the church as the site for a parsonage and glebe. A parsonage, named Hillside, was built on the site for Reverend Benjamin Glennie. He visited England in 1857 where he married his wife, Charlotte Augusta Dring Drake (daughter of Sir William Henry Drake). The couple returned to Glengallan in early 1858, but left again and returned to England in 1860. Charles travelled to Queensland alone in late 1864 and arranged for Deuchar to buy out his interest. Marshall retired from the partnership and departed for England in April 1865, but was to return to Australia due to Deuchar's financial difficulties in 1870.[1]\n\nDuring their partnership, Marshall and Deuchar established the famous Glengallan Merino flock and Shorthorn stud.[1]\n\n\nStud merino rams at Glengallan Station, 1894\nJohn Deuchar (1820-1872) was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and with his sister Beatrice migrated to New South Wales in 1839. He gained pastoral experience in the Hunter River district and c.1842 drove sheep from Maitland to the Darling Downs for the Aberdeen Co, and later for the North British Australian Co. From 1844 he was overseer at Goomburra, and after two years with the support of Walter Grey of Ipswich, he bought Canal Creek well stocked with Talgai Merinos. In 1848 Deuchar sold Canal Creek, and succeeded Fred Bracker as manager of Rosenthal for the Aberdeen Co, and became travelling superintendent of the company's properties. In 1829 Bracker, from Mecklenburg, Germany, had brought to New South Wales a flock of Saxon Merinos of the Rambouillet family from Prince Esterhazy's Silesian flock for the Aberdeen Co. On Rosenthal, Deuchar had the first two thoroughbred Merino rams on the Darling Downs; Camden Billy from John Macarthur's stud at Camden Park, already there when he took over, and German Billy, which he brought with him from Canal Creek. A fine Merino stud was developed from a blend of Spanish Negretti Cabana and Rambouillet strains, developing long, superfine wool. Deuchar began breeding cattle, especially Shorthorns, and brought to Rosenthal Lord Raglan, the first imported Shorthorn bull to reach the Downs, and well bred cattle from the Australian Agricultural Co's properties farther south. He also developed a horse racing stud, and his stallion Grey Arab, bought from one of the Aberdeen Co's properties, sired many fine horses which Deuchar rode successfully at race meetings both on the flat and over fences.[1]\n\nIn 1855 Deuchar went into partnership with Marshall on Glengallan, and continued his stock breeding. His overseer William Anderson had been at school with him and had come to the colony on the same ship. Deuchar insisted on building up his own teams of employees, and on taking over Rosenthal and Glengallan he dispersed the families on the properties and replaced them with other employees already known to him.[1]\n\nIn 1857 Deuchar married Eliza Charlotte Lee, the sister of Dr Washington Lee of Warwick, in Paddington Sydney, and travelled to Europe in 1858-60 where he purchased stock which would become important in building up Glengallan's flocks. In Germany Deuchar selected ten rams and ten ewes from the flocks of Baron Von Malzahn at Lenschow in Mecklenburg, of which Marshall made a further selection of ten rams and fifteen ewes in 1862, the last time that outside blood was introduced and the Glengallan Merinos were bred up from this stock.[1]\n\nBy 1865 Marshall and Deuchar had pre-empted 18,172 acres (7,354 ha), which rose to 31,166 acres (12,612 ha) by the end of 1867. This was 66% of the total run area which totalled 44,800 acres (18,100 ha), being the highest percentage of pre-empted selection of land of any run in the 1860-1874 period.[1]\n\nBy 1864 the Glengallan Head Station complex included two houses, stables and a kitchen, with new stables having been built prior to 1858. In 1866 it was described by Kate Hume, a visitor, as the house has been added to, till it resembles a village, connected by verandahs and covered ways![1]\n\nGlengallan Homestead was constructed in 1867-68, and it is thought that Deuchar had been planning his house for some time. The extant office\/store building with cellar was constructed in 1864 by local builder Donald Meiklejohn from local sandstone, and is thought to be both experimental and an integral part of the total envisaged precinct. A variety of sizes of sandstone block was used, unlike the regular masonry of the house or the irregular stonework of the verandah foundation. It has been suggested that the cellar was experimental in determining the movement and depth of the black soil, and that subsequently cellars were not chosen for the main house. It appears that the cellar was a cold store, and that the dry goods store was above, with the estate office.[1]\n\nDeuchar had intended to build a much larger house, possibly in a U-shape plan, although he only had time and resources to build one wing of Glengallan Homestead. Unconfirmed reports state that a massive hole was dug for the foundations, up to 20 feet (6.1 m) wider than the building, till sandstone was reached. On this sandstone a massive platform of basalt rubble was laid, and the outer and dividing walls were then constructed and the intervening spaces refilled to ground level. During construction the Warwick Examiner and Times noted in November 1867 that Glengallan will be one of the most splendid gentlemen's residences in the colony.[1]\n\nThe sandstone for Glengallan Homestead was quarried on the property, from an area near Swan Creek at Yangan, and the verandah sandstone, much coarser and softer, comes from Karcaruda, which was a former settlement and railway siding near Swan Creek.[1]\n\nThe construction of Glengallan was supervised by Warwick builder Thomas Wood, possibly for architect Charles Balding who, based in Ipswich, had opened a temporary office in Toowoomba and his practice extended to the Darling Downs. Balding had designed Gooloowan in Quarry Street, Ipswich, for Benjamin Cribb, which was built in 1863-64 and is noted as being similar to Glengallan. It has also been suggested that Richard George Suter (1827-1894) may have been involved, possibly taking over from Balding who left the colony in 1867. Suter later designed Jimbour House, a two-storeyed sandstone homestead built 1873-74.[1]\n\nDeuchar had two suites of furniture made at Ebenstons in Queen Street, Brisbane, for the drawing and dining rooms. The fact that local materials and a local manufacturer were used was publicised in the Brisbane Courier in August 1868. Reports of the cost of the house vary between \u00a35-12,000, and a gala opening party was held on 16 September 1868. The Deuchars hosted many social events during their time at Glengallan, and house guests included Governor Bowen and his family. Deuchar had envisaged the ground floor rooms as drawing room (north) and ball room (south), but were actually used as drawing room (south) and dining room (north) with bedrooms on the first floor.[1]\n\nNine months after the opening party, Glengallan was offered for sale. The cost of the pre-emptive purchase, building a grand house, a drought, and buying Marshall out of the partnership all contributed to Deuchar's financial ruin. In early 1865 Deuchar had taken over sole control of the management of Glengallan, and contracted to buy the property by taking out a mortgage with Marshall payable in ten years.[1]\n\nDeuchar was unable to pay instalments on the mortgage and in early 1869 Marshall agreed to Deuchar raising finance elsewhere and paying him out.[3] This did not occur and Deuchar, who also had significant other debts, sought to sell Glengallan starting in May 1869.[4] Brewster and Trebeck sought to auction the property on 7 July 1869,[5] deferred this to 21 July, but failed to attract a satisfactory bid.[6] The beginning of the end came in August when the Bank of Australasia started legal proceedings in the Queensland Supreme Court against Deuchar for the payment of an outstanding overdraft.[7] Another sale of Glengallan was proposed for 2 February 1870,[8] but this did not go ahead because Deuchar was declared bankrupt on that date.[9] At a final hearing in April 1870 Deuchar's proven debts were \u00a397,000 with \u00a380,329 owed to Marshall and \u00a315,859 to bankers.[10] The valuation of Glengallan, including all its stock, property and chattels, was \u00a380,000 so Marshall exercised his pre-emptive, and secured, rights as mortgagee and took possession of Glengallan. This included the Deuchar silver plate (much of which had been paid for by Charles in England) and other contents of the household. Deuchar retired to Mile End in Warwick where he died of pneumonia aged 50 on 11 September 1872, survived by his wife, two daughters and six sons.[1]\n\nDuring Deuchar's occupation, the servants quarters and buggy shed were built, and the gardens and avenue of trees were laid out. The house water supply and sewerage disposal system was also developed, with the water being pumped from the creek using a 2.5 horse-power Bailey engine, and the pump appears to have been set on a sandstone block platform. The water was pumped to a holding tank below the bathroom, then up to a 200-gallon lead lined wooden roof tank supplying cold water for bath, shower and flushing toilet on the first floor. The large size of the roof tank was probably due to the type of toilet system used, a rare feature at the time, which had been invented in 1778 and required high water pressure. The pump was also used to irrigate the gardens around the house.[1]\n\nDuring the next 20 years, the two early houses were demolished, and the covered way to one of the houses was truncated. A rear wing, known as the cedar wing, was built to provide guest rooms, estate office, cook's bedroom and housekeeper's room. The kitchen was built adjoining the side of the covered way, but separate from the stone house, and was set on stumps with a large chimney at its eastern end. The bath house was built against the western end of the south verandah.[1]\n\nMarshall returned in November 1870[11] and remained until 1873 when he took William Ball Slade into partnership and again retired to England where he died in August 1874. The partnership continued however, with Marshall's share transferred to his widow, Charlotte Augusta Dring Marshall, until 1904 when the property was sold.[1] Charlotte asked Slade to return the Deuchar silver plate to Eliza Deuchar in 1877.[12]\n\nA new woolshed was completed to the northwest of the house in 1873, being approximately three times the size of the present woolshed. The earliest position of the woolshed is noted in 1859-60. The 1873 woolshed is noted as having a T-shape plan and could accommodate 22 shearers, and was described in 1892 as being a hardwood structure, with a shingle roof, that could accommodate 1,000 sheep. The exact position of the washpool has been disputed, but some sources indicate that it was located upstream from the house. Clean wool was abandoned in favour of greasy wool with the cessation of sheep washing in the 1870s.[1]\n\nDuring WB Slade's time at Glengallan, many changes occurred resulting from the increased diversification of the property into dairying and crops. In the open areas fostered by the Aboriginal land management practices, prior to European settlement, a pasture dominated by nutritious grasses had developed. These grasses did not survive intensified stocking, particularly when fencing became a standard practice, and less nutritious grasses took their place. A gradual decline in the carrying capacity was noted during the period 1860-1880, and the solution was to improve the feed and as a result lucerne became a major crop.[1]\n\nFrom 1842-1868 any cultivation was limited to paddocks lower than the house and closer to the creek. After 1868, Deuchar's pump, installed to deliver water to the house, was used to irrigate nearby fields. After 1880, the benefit of lucerne as a fodder crop was recognised and the cultivation of wheat and other grains began to assume importance. For the following 80 to 90 years, many of the paddocks above and near the house were cultivated for crops, and much soil was washed away.[1]\n\n\nStud short horn bulls at Glengallan Station, 1894\nWilliam Ball Slade (1843-1938) was born in Somerset, England, and after some legal training migrated to Sydney in 1861 where his elder brother was practising as a solicitor. After pastoral experience in New South Wales and Queensland, Slade married Sophia Thompson on 1 March 1873 at St Mark's Church of England Warwick, and that year became manager and partner of Glengallan. Deuchar had established notable Shorthorn and Merino studs, and between the droughts of 1872 and 1902 Slade developed the Shorthorn stud to over one thousand pedigree females, one of the largest in the world. The Merino stud had such prestige that Slade maintained a closed flock until 1916. During that time he developed a heavier-fleeced flock, with wool that was stronger, of greater length and often brighter. He kept another line of Merinos of Vermont strain, separate from the Glengallan foundation stock, and also bred Lincolns. He exported stud Merinos to the Cape of Good Hope in 1888, a connection which was long continued.[1]\n\nMany more staff were required at Glengallan, even though shepherding was abandoned in favour of fenced paddocks, and sheep washing ceased in the 1870s. Glengallan concentrated on stud sheep and cattle, with fat lambs becoming important once rail transport and refrigeration came into the economic realm. One of Slade's achievements was to transform Glengallan from a traditional pastoral stud property to one where intensive cultivation of lucerne and other fodder supported not only the stud stock but also wethers bought for fattening from western properties, and he was praised by contemporaries as the best manager in the Darling Downs. Further diversification included dairying and a substantial piggery.[1]\n\nAt some point it appears that the main flow of Glengallan Creek became diverted down Backwater Creek, for what reason is not known. By 1892 three dams had been constructed on Glengallan Creek to provide irrigation to the paddocks. Water was still being pumped from the creek in the 1890s, but by the early 1900s water was being supplied by a bore on the northwest of Mt Marshall to a holding tank near the woolshed, and the house water system was reliant on rain water. The original timber shingles to the roof of Glengallan were sheeted over with corrugated iron and stormwater drainage was introduced. Pipes were installed at both the northwest and southwest corners of the house, with the northwest pipe feeding into the stone lined channel that runs along the west side of house with sandstone capping pieces. Pipes also fed into the roof tank.[1]\n\nIn 1885 Glengallan covered 42,000 acres (17,000 ha), and from 1896 to 1904 Glengallan was progressively broken up into smaller units. After the original leases had expired in the 1860s, lease holders were permitted to acquire large areas by pre-emptive claim and further purchases. Considerable pressures were put upon the pastoralists due to demand for smaller land holdings, eventually resulting in the Selection Acts of the 1860s and 1870s which forced them to borrow heavily, and the fluctuation of wool prices meant that it was difficult for them to make a profit. The Agricultural Lands Purchase Act of 1894 was the instrument by which many of the large estates on the Downs were broken up. Under this Act, the Glengallan partnership restored its capital and recouped drought losses in three major subdivisions between 1895 and 1904, when the partnership came to an end. Slade actively offered his property to the Government and lobbied local Members of Parliament to assist in ensuring his offer was accepted.[1]\n\nIn 1904, after the three major subdivisions, Slade retained 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) and repurchased the Glengallan Homestead block, reportedly between 1,275 and 2,000 acres (810 ha) in size, from the Government for \u00a310,265. Later in 1904, Slade transferred the Glengallan Homestead and accompanying 482 acres (195 ha) to GH Gillespie, a member of the well known firm of Victorian Millers. It appears that by 1907, Clara Gillespie was farming the Glengallan Homestead portion with her son Alexander Frederick Gillespie.[1]\n\nSlade named his smaller estate East Glengallan, built himself a residence and continued with the Glengallan Merino and Shorthorn studs. Slade acquired properties near Warwick and at Gore, towards Inglewood, for his family. In 1912 East Glengallan was subdivided with the eldest son Oswald Carey Slade (1882-1956) managing the Merino stud. Slade's other son Adrian also managed or was proprietor of award-winning studs.[1]\n\nWB Slade is celebrated as the archetypal Anglo-Australian patrician of Warwick, and was patron, office-bearer and benefactor of show societies, his church, Masonic Lodge and the Warwick branch of the Royal Society of St George. His great avocation was cricket, and he donated Slade Park to the Queensland I Zingari Cricket Club, which formed 1868 and of which he was one of the first members and Captain for almost 30 years. He established annual cricket matches at Glengallan and a pavilion was constructed. In 1932 he was appointed CBE, and he died 18 April 1938 and is buried in the Warwick cemetery. His name is remembered by the Slade School, Warwick.[1]\n\nSlade established a school, which had opened by 1886, and paid for its construction, desks, furniture and teacher. It was taken over by the Education Department in 1891, and was closed and relocated in 1904 when that portion of Glengallan was purchased by the government. Slade also gave 2 acres (0.81 ha) to the Anglican Church, and St Andrew's Church was opened in 1908. St Andrew's was described as a weatherboard church that could accommodate 200 people, painted dark red with pale green glass casement windows and a vestry at the western end. The church has since been relocated to St David's, Allora, and is attached to the hall.[1]\n\nThe only alteration made to Glengallan Homestead by Slade is thought to be the timber partition in the first floor northern room to accommodate children's bedrooms.[1]\n\nBy 1904 the structures at the head station consisted of Glengallan Homestead, with the rear cedar wing, kitchen and bath house attached, sandstone office\/store, two storeyed stables, buggy shed, and servants quarters. The garden comprised a tennis court (often used for cricket practice) to the northeast of the house, a gravel\/cobbled semi- circular drive lined by semi-circular garden beds and an extensive shrubbery, a lawn with a central circular garden, a tree lined drive (planted by Deuchar), and a box hedge separating the formal garden from the productive gardens. An orchard was located on the southern side of the house and was terraced down to Glengallan Creek which was fringed with willows. A vegetable garden was also located on the southern side or behind the house. Glengallan was described as giving the appearance of a picturesquely scattered township, and included many outbuildings and a large complex of structures nearer to the woolshed.[1]\n\nClara Gillespie was declared insolvent in July 1910, and it appears that the property was transferred to her son Alexander Frederick Gillespie in January 1912. It is noted that financial problems plagued AF Gillespie, and during his occupation of the property there appears to have been no new buildings erected and some may have begun to deteriorate. It appears that the Glengallan Homestead portion was transferred to Oswald Carey Slade (son of WB Slade) in July 1918, and AF Gillespie died in 1926-27.[1]\n\nOswald Carey Slade installed a manager, and it is recorded that the Atkinson family lived in the main house in 1927. Another manager and his family occupied the house from 1931 until he retired due to ill health in 1944-45. This was the last family to live at the house. During OC Slade's ownership, the property further deteriorated with the area between the house and the office\/store turned into a farmyard.[1]\n\nIn 1919, Glengallan was described as being approached via a winding drive over a quarter mile long, with magnificent pine trees lining either side of the drive, a neat picket fence of 270 yards (250 m) surrounds the garden area, broken by a substantial gateway of stone pillars and iron gates. It was also described as having cobbled areas to the north side of the house and approaching the office\/store doors, a fernery, small vineyard, homestead enclosure and adjacent small paddocks irrigated by pipes which were supplied by elevated tanks filled by a pump, stables with feed room and harness room, buggy shed for three vehicles, and a couple of six-room cottages for married men and their families. By this time, much of the infrastructure which originally supported Glengallan would have been disused or much modified.[1]\n\n\nLeslie centenary memorial gates, 2015\nThe two-storeyed stables burned down, probably in the late 1920s, and a stone paved and corrugated iron roofed shed was erected partly over the site. This was possibly also the site of the earlier stables as sketched by Conrad Martens in 1852, which were also possibly built on the site of the c.1842 stables. In the early 1930s the first floor of Glengallan House was unoccupied and the servants quarters, a long narrow timber building comprising rooms opening onto a verandah, was demolished. The stone pillars and iron gates were removed in 1940 to Leslie Park in Warwick where they were re-used to commemorate the centenary of the arrival of the Leslie brothers and the establishment of Canning Downs.[13][14] In 1946 the kitchen and bath house were removed to other parts of the property, and later that year the cedar wing was dismantled and sold to Eddie Mogridge of Tannymorel, and it has subsequently been moved to Swanfels. The remains of a cemetery is located at a distance from Glengallan House to the southwest, but the date of establishment is not known.[1]\n\nOswald Carey Slade was childless, and in 1931 he transferred East Glengallan to the Anglican Church, subject to a life tenancy.[1]\n\nIn 1949 Mr and Mrs OC Slade gave Glengallan Homestead to the Anglican Church. The Anglican Church had plans to dismantle Glengallan and use the materials to build a War Memorial Science Block at the Slade School in Warwick, but this did not eventuate. The school leased the property to various people for farming purposes.[1]\n\nAfter the property was accepted by the Anglican Church, no development was seriously attempted. Glengallan Homestead was left often open and used as shelter by goats and birds, and many of the fittings were removed. In 1972 the property was transferred to the Smith family. Glengallan was left unoccupied, its remaining gardens were turned into paddocks, and the slow creep of soil from cultivated paddocks above was allowed to continue. The only visible structures were the main house and the sandstone office\/store.[1]\n\nA 1975 report noted that the structure was in reasonably good condition, some sheets of corrugated iron had blown off the roof and the verandahs had deteriorated. By 1983 the southern verandah had collapsed and the eastern verandah was unstable, water was entering the building and more corrugated iron sheets were missing.[1]\n\nIn 1983, a group of fourth year architecture students from the University of Queensland made a set of measured drawings of Glengallan House. These were followed up by a conservation analysis funded by a National Estate Grant in 1983, 1984 and 1986, carried out by the Department of Architecture University of Queensland. Recommendations for the conservation and management of Glengallan were made, but no organisation was willing to undertake them. In 1993 Glengallan House and its surrounding grounds were gifted to the non-profit Glengallan Homestead Trust which was formed in 1993.[1]\n\nSince then archaeological excavations have been carried out, mainly involving the drainage, water and sewerage systems. However, works have also been carried out resulting in some damage to the property. These works include the removal of black soil overburden, the provision of water, power and telephone, the installation of a toilet block and septic system, excavation for rebuilding of verandah walls, the construction of a shed, and the verandahs have been largely removed. The roof has been repaired, with some new structural members being inserted, and resheeted with corrugated iron with some of the original timber shingles being retained in situ.[1]\n\nGlengallan Homestead is open to the public for viewing.[15]\n\nDescription\n\nWall showing ruinous state before conservation, 2015\nGlengallan Homestead is located on the southwestern slope of Mount Marshall at the mouth of a wide valley, running west from Cunningham's Gap, near the junction of the Cunningham and New England Highways approximately 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) north of Warwick. The fenced area of land on which the homestead is located is accessed via an easement from the New England Highway to the southwest. The homestead has been in a ruinous condition but is undergoing conservation works.[1]\n\nThe homestead is a long, narrow two-storeyed ashlar sandstone structure, built on an approximately north-south axis, with a hipped corrugated iron roof. The symmetrical principal elevation faces in an easterly direction overlooking the valley and towards Mount Dumaresq in the distance, which it resembles in silhouette. The rear elevation has projecting sandstone blocks on the north and south ends, indicating the intended two-storeyed extensions which were never built and which would have formed a U-shaped plan. The building originally had a timber shingled roof, and some of these shingles remain under the corrugated iron sheeting.[1]\n\nThe building has the remains of double height verandahs to the north, east and south. The most intact section of verandah is located at the northern end, with the southern end almost completely missing. The ground floor verandahs have paired, narrow ornamental cast iron columns, which were produced by the Russell Foundry of Sydney, in front and to either side of a tubular cast iron column which was intended to support the load above. These columns are currently in place only to the northern end and part of the western side, and are supported by sandstone plinths which in turn are supported by a footing wall. The paired Russell Foundry columns were also located on the first floor verandah where they acted as structural members. The inside face of the columns had timber panelling which, to the ground floor verandah, aligned with expressed false beams in the timber panelled ceiling. The ground floor columns support a timber web truss, which in turn supports the first floor verandah above. The first floor verandah had cast iron balustrades, also produced by the Russell Foundry, which have been removed.[1]\n\nThe ground floor verandahs originally had a fixed timber louvred panelled frieze, which was the remnants of a louvred system intended to have panels which ran in tracks located at the side of the columns allowing the verandah to be enclosed, but where venetian blinds were installed instead. The ground floor verandahs had timber floors which have been removed, and a central set of sandstone steps accessing the main entrance on the eastern side.[1]\n\n\nFanlights, 2015\nThe east and south walls have smooth faced sandstone blocks, while the north and west walls have picked faced sandstone. Both floors have French doors with arched fanlights opening onto the verandahs, with three sets of doors either side of the central entry, and all arched headers have expressed vermiculated keystones. The central entry has double doors with sidelights, and an arched fanlight with coloured glass segments surmounted by an expressed keystone carved in relief with the initials JD 1867 surrounded by a garland of leaves. The doors and sidelights have timber lower panels with etched, arched glazed upper panels. The French doors are similar and open inwards. Originally these doors had a second set of doors which opened outwards and contained a timber lower panel with an upper panel of copper mesh, presumably as an insect screen. The ground floor north and south elevations have a projecting sandstone bay with a central French door flanked by a tall, narrow sash window.[1]\n\nThe ground floor western wall has timber panelled doors with arched fanlight at the north and south ends. A similar doorway is located in the centre under the internal staircase, but the door is missing. These doors are accessed by rough sandstone steps and a timber ramp, and a stone lined stormwater drain is located in front of and running parallel to this wall. A tall sash window is located above the central door, with a smaller sash to either side. This symmetrical elevation has two chimney stacks which have picked-faced sandstone to the base, and smooth-faced sandstone above surmounted by a large cornice with curved capping pieces. The western wall has marks in the sandstone above the northern door which indicate the roof profile of the covered way which was originally located connected there.[1]\n\n\nDining room, 2015\nInternally, the building has a symmetrical plan with a central hall and stairwell flanked by the former dining room on the north and former drawing room on the south. The first floor has a bedroom at either end, separated from the stairwell by an ante room and linked by a short hallway. The plaster finishes are thought to be original, but have suffered much water damage.[1]\n\nAll the masonry walls are plastered, and on the first floor the non-masonry walls are lath and plaster. The ceilings are lath and plaster, and all rooms have plaster cornices, with the widths and designs varying in different rooms. Principal rooms have ornate central plaster ceiling roses, with the dining room containing two roses which would have been positioned above a central table. Throughout the building, the skirtings, architraves, doors and floor boards are cedar. Doors are panelled with etched, arched glass fanlights, and evidence of early decoration include brackets for curtain rods.[1]\n\n\nDrawing room, 2015\nThe drawing room originally had a white marble fireplace surround with relief carving of fruit, and the dining room had a black marble fireplace surround, both of which have been removed. The main bedroom, on the south, has a cedar fireplace surround and evidence of a shelving unit which was located between the chimney breast and adjacent wall but was probably not an original fitting. The adjacent ante-room housed a bathroom, and surviving evidence include vertically jointed timber panelling and a cedar surround for a shower rose. The bathroom originally housed a slate bath and flushing toilet. The northern bedroom has a vertically jointed timber partition wall which divides the room in two but which does not reach the ceiling height. This room had a cedar fireplace surround which has been removed, but the register grate is in place. The adjacent ante-room is thought to have been a nursery or dressing room.[1]\n\nThe stairwell contains a U-shaped curving cedar staircase which as been partly restored. A protective timber cover and temporary handrail has been installed, with the original turned cedar balustrade and handrail in place to the first floor landing. The stair is lit by a tall sash window.[1]\n\nTo the west of the homestead is the office\/store. This single-storeyed sandstone building has a hipped corrugated iron roof, which originally had timber shingles, and a cellar. The stonework consists of a rough alternation of thick and thin bands, and the northern elevation has a central entrance flanked by a window to either side. A second entrance is located on the eastern side facing the homestead, two windows are located on the southern side, and the cellar is entered from the west via a flight of seven sandstone steps, but the original entrance door has been removed. The building has air vents to the cellar just above ground level. Internally, this building originally had two rooms with separate entries, but the internal wall has been removed. The walls are plastered and a ceiling has been installed. Remains of cobbled paths around the building are evident.[1]\n\nCultivation of the paddocks above the homestead has resulted in the site being mantled in 300 millimetres (12 in) of black soil. Some of this overburden has been removed, but the majority of the site has been protected and the position of early structures may be able to be identified with further investigation. Excavations have been undertaken to the site of the cedar wing and kitchen complex, stables, stormwater drains and sewerage system, and to a large part of the area north and west of the office. The site boundary fence passes across the corner of the partly excavated area of the stables.[1]\n\nThe remains of the gardens include two Norfolk Island Pines appear to mark the position of the original entrance gates and stone pillars to the northeast of the homestead. The form of the raised tennis court and curved drive can be determined, and a number of mature trees are located at the northern end of the homestead. Remains of the orchard, to the south of the homestead, include a number of gnarled and twisted fruit trees.[1]\n\n\nMummified cat, 2015\nAn unexpected discovery during conservation works was the remains of a mummified cat underneath the floorboards. It is not known if the cat was accidentally entombed there or whether it was linked to medieval practice to ward off evil spirits, possibly linked to building trade guilds.[16]\n\nHeritage listing\nGlengallan Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.[1]\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\n\nThe district surrounding Glengallan Homestead was part of the area Allan Cunningham discovered and explored in 1827. The Glengallan Run was part of the first Darling Downs run, selected by Patrick Leslie in 1840, and was established and named by brothers Colin and John Campbell in 1841-42. The approximate site of the present homestead appears to have been established c.1842, and since that time has been located in a pivotal position on the main roads, which have changed slightly in position, from Toowoomba\/Drayton heading towards the south and from the Downs properties heading towards Cunningham's Gap.[1]\n\nThe homestead was built in 1867-68 by John Deuchar who, with partner Charles Henry Marshall, established the famous Glengallan Merino flock and Shorthorn stud. The breeding tradition established by Deuchar was further developed by William Ball Slade who maintained the pre-eminence of the Glengallan stud from 1873 until the property was sold in 1904. Slade also transformed Glengallan from a traditional pastoral stud property to one where intensive cultivation of lucerne and other fodder supported not only the stud stock but also wethers bought for fattening from western properties. Further diversification included dairying and a substantial piggery, and Slade was praised by his contemporaries as the best manager on the Darling Downs. Slade was also described as the archetypal Anglo-Australian patrician of Warwick, being a patron, office-bearer, benefactor and member of numerous societies, clubs, the Masonic Lodge and Anglican Church.[1]\n\nThe place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.\n\nGlengallan Homestead is a two-storeyed sandstone structure and as such, with the exception of Jimbour House, is a rare example of a Queensland homestead of that period which were mainly single-storeyed timber structures. Although the homestead was built as part of a larger, uncompleted design, the grand architectural concept can be appreciated and, with its picturesque siting, the building is recognised as a landmark in the surrounding rural landscape.[1]\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.\n\nThe site contains archaeological remains which could provide further information concerning the living conditions on the property and the development of the homestead and associated complex of buildings from the 1840s.[1]\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.\n\nThe homestead and surrounding landscape provide evidence of the way of life of a large Darling Downs Station, from its establishment to eventual decline, and the building is symbolic of the power and prestige of the Darling Downs squatters in the mid to late nineteenth century.[1]\n\nThe place is important because of its aesthetic significance.\n\nAs a ruin of a grand homestead, which has strong associations with the history and pastoral development of the Darling Downs, the building has unique aesthetic and cultural attributes and has been the subject of much community concern and recent conservation action, as reflected in its current administration by the Glengallan Homestead Trust Ltd.[1]\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.\n\nThe fabric of the building exhibits a sophisticated design approach, and the detailing of the materials reflects a fine quality of craftsmanship. Some elements of the building were technically innovative for the time, particularly the verandah louvre system and French doors with insect screens, reflecting a consideration for the Queensland climate and conditions.[1]\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nAs a ruin of a grand homestead, which has strong associations with the history and pastoral development of the Darling Downs, the building has unique aesthetic and cultural attributes and has been the subject of much community concern and recent conservation action, as reflected in its current administration by the Glengallan Homestead Trust Ltd.\n\nThe place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.\n\nThe district surrounding Glengallan Homestead was part of the area Allan Cunningham discovered and explored in 1827.

Cunningham found a gap in the dividing range, and the following year, while visiting Moreton Bay, he found a gap which he thought was the same one he had discovered previously, and which became known as Cunningham's Gap.[1]\n\nThis open country had been carefully and deliberately maintained by the Aborigines in what has been called firestick farming, an annual pattern of controlled burns to protect certain resource areas and pasture for native grazing animals. The Aboriginal burning pattern was disrupted within the first years of the runs being taken up, and the local Aboriginal population were soon killed off.[1]\n\nThe unsettled districts outside the nineteen counties around Sydney had been thrown open to squatters by the 1836 licence system. This system proved ineffective and in 1839 a new Act was passed. This Act provided for an annual licence fee to be paid, determined per head of stock on the run, and also provided administration by Commissioners of Crown Lands. However, the squatters still had no permanency of land tenure, and in 1847 Orders in Council were introduced which allowed further 14 year leases for established unsettled runs on payment of an annual fee per head of stock. The Orders in Council also gave the run holders the pre-emptive right to purchase the land for its fair value in an unimproved state at less than one pound per acre at the completion of the lease. Pre-emption was allowed to continue until 1868, and meant that nearly all the best land, creek frontages, water holes and portions guarding leasehold areas were pre-empted. It allowed the squatters to hold onto their land, but also plunged many of them into debt often resulting in financial ruin.[1]\n\nPatrick Leslie (1815-1881) born at Warthill, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the second son of William Leslie, ninth laird of Warthill and eight of Folla, had sailed from London in 1834 and arrived in New South Wales in May 1835. He gained pastoralist experience under the Macarthurs of Camden, and in 1836 went to manage the property of his uncle Davidson on the Krui River at Colleroi. By 1839 Leslie had rented Dunheved farm at Penrith, and when his brothers Walter and George arrived he decided to look for new land north of the limits of settlement. In 1840 he started with a large party for the Clarence River district, and then resolved to look at the Darling Downs. With one companion, a convict named Murphy, he followed Cunningham's trail and relocated the Darling Downs and decided on the area that was to become Toolburra and Canning Downs for his first station. Walter Leslie and Ernest Dalrymple followed with the flocks, and in 1840 the Leslies became the first settlers on the Darling Downs.[1]\n\nErnest Dalrymple took up a run next to the Leslies, and all runs on the Downs were taken up by June 1841. The Leslies originally selected all the land which became Toolburra, South Toolburra, Glengallan, Gladfield, Maryvale, Warwick and Canning Downs, and had taken up a far greater area than which they were entitled under a New South Wales licence. They had to dispose of the areas that became Glengallan, Sandy Creek, and Fred (Bracker) the German's Creek (Rosenthal) to the Aberdeen Company.[1]\n\nThe Leslies negotiated permission to bring supplies from the Moreton Bay settlement, even though it was not open to commerce. The settlement opened in 1842 however, and thereafter all the Downs squatters (run holders) were free to have supplies sent in and wool sent out to Ipswich, from where they could be transported by river to Brisbane.[1]\n\nIn 1841-42 the Leslie brothers sold approximately 42,000 acres (17,000 ha) to brothers Colin and John Campbell, Scottish immigrants, who named it Glengallan Run. The Leslies noted they had disposed of the buildings and the right of the lower part of the run for which they had no use and they had received \u00a3250 for it. This description may have included Glengallan, Fred the German's Creek and Sandy Creek.[1]\n\nBy 1844, Campbell and Co were in liquidation, but the partnership recovered and after 1844 it appears that licences for Glengallan were issued in the sole name of Colin Campbell. Another brother, Archibald, managed the property from 1845\u201348 and during this time the stock numbers increased considerably, but disease broke out in 1847. Glengallan was offered for sale in November 1847, but this was not successful.[1]\n\nThe Campbell's first encampment had been at Freestone Creek, an area which has become known as Campbell Plains, but it proved unsuitable for sheep due to wooded areas and dingo habitat. The camp subsequently moved to Glengallan Creek, known as Gap Creek, near the slope of what became Mt Marshall. It has been suggested that their c.1842 residence, described as a rude but substantial hut, would have been close to the site of the present homestead being close to the creek but above flood level, with expansive views of the surrounding area and a relatively flat terrace of land, but the exact location has not been positively identified. The 1846 diary of the New South Wales Commissioner for Crown Lands, Darling Downs District, stated the run was 120 square miles with 15,000 head of sheep, 400 cattle and 30 horses. In 1848, a NSW Government Gazette noted Colin Campbell holding leases for Glengallan totalling 60,000 acres (24,000 ha). Glengallan was located in a pivotal position on the main roads, which have changed slightly in position, from Toowoomba\/Drayton heading towards the south and from the Downs properties heading towards Cunningham's Gap.[1]\n\nThe NSW Government Gazette published a list of transfers of runs dated 11 October 1848 recording the transfer of Glengallan from Colin Campbell to the unrelated Robert Tertius Campbell (1811-1887) with whom Colin Campbell banked, and it appears that the three Campbell brothers died in 1853. Robert Tertius Campbell, whose father was a Director of the Bank of New South Wales, was related to the Campbells of Duntroon in the Monaro district, and had been lessee of Jondaryan in 1845, gained the lease of North Branch of Swamps Run in 1849, and continued leasing Canning Creek until 1852. The NSW Government Gazette dated 30 July 1852 recorded that RT Campbell transferred his interest in Glengallan to his partner Charles Henry Marshall, who had previously been his managing clerk and whom he took into partnership in Glengallan it appears in 1849-50. RT Campbell then moved on to the newly opened Burnett District.[1]\n\nIn December 1851 and March 1852, the artist Conrad Martens (1801-1878), who had arrived in Sydney in 1835, stayed at Glengallan during the course of his five-month trip to the Brisbane area and the Darling Downs in search of painting commissions. He travelled through the country making pencil drawings, many of which he used as the basis for water colours and oil paintings, which he executed on his return to Sydney. These drawings and paintings are some of the few illustrations of Queensland during this time, and his sketches of Glengallan show the main homestead as two timber buildings surrounded by verandahs and situated close together.[1]\n\nCharles Henry Marshall (1818-1874) was born in Mauritius and had a background in Leith in Scotland and Totnes in Devon, England. He came to Australia in 1842[2] as Bookkeeper for the Van Diemen's Land Company at Circular Head (Stanley) and was Superintendent of the company's Woolnorth Station at Cape Grim from 1846 to 1849 after which he moved to Queensland. He was appointed Magistrate in 1849-50 and took John Deuchar into partnership in 1855. Marshall was an active member of the Church of England, and in 1858 gave 11 acres (4.5 ha) of land in Warwick to the church as the site for a parsonage and glebe. A parsonage, named Hillside, was built on the site for Reverend Benjamin Glennie. He visited England in 1857 where he married his wife, Charlotte Augusta Dring Drake (daughter of Sir William Henry Drake). The couple returned to Glengallan in early 1858, but left again and returned to England in 1860. Charles travelled to Queensland alone in late 1864 and arranged for Deuchar to buy out his interest. Marshall retired from the partnership and departed for England in April 1865, but was to return to Australia due to Deuchar's financial difficulties in 1870.[1]\n\nDuring their partnership, Marshall and Deuchar established the famous Glengallan Merino flock and Shorthorn stud.[1]\n\n\nStud merino rams at Glengallan Station, 1894\nJohn Deuchar (1820-1872) was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and with his sister Beatrice migrated to New South Wales in 1839. He gained pastoral experience in the Hunter River district and c.1842 drove sheep from Maitland to the Darling Downs for the Aberdeen Co, and later for the North British Australian Co. From 1844 he was overseer at Goomburra, and after two years with the support of Walter Grey of Ipswich, he bought Canal Creek well stocked with Talgai Merinos. In 1848 Deuchar sold Canal Creek, and succeeded Fred Bracker as manager of Rosenthal for the Aberdeen Co, and became travelling superintendent of the company's properties. In 1829 Bracker, from Mecklenburg, Germany, had brought to New South Wales a flock of Saxon Merinos of the Rambouillet family from Prince Esterhazy's Silesian flock for the Aberdeen Co. On Rosenthal, Deuchar had the first two thoroughbred Merino rams on the Darling Downs; Camden Billy from John Macarthur's stud at Camden Park, already there when he took over, and German Billy, which he brought with him from Canal Creek. A fine Merino stud was developed from a blend of Spanish Negretti Cabana and Rambouillet strains, developing long, superfine wool. Deuchar began breeding cattle, especially Shorthorns, and brought to Rosenthal Lord Raglan, the first imported Shorthorn bull to reach the Downs, and well bred cattle from the Australian Agricultural Co's properties farther south. He also developed a horse racing stud, and his stallion Grey Arab, bought from one of the Aberdeen Co's properties, sired many fine horses which Deuchar rode successfully at race meetings both on the flat and over fences.[1]\n\nIn 1855 Deuchar went into partnership with Marshall on Glengallan, and continued his stock breeding. His overseer William Anderson had been at school with him and had come to the colony on the same ship. Deuchar insisted on building up his own teams of employees, and on taking over Rosenthal and Glengallan he dispersed the families on the properties and replaced them with other employees already known to him.[1]\n\nIn 1857 Deuchar married Eliza Charlotte Lee, the sister of Dr Washington Lee of Warwick, in Paddington Sydney, and travelled to Europe in 1858-60 where he purchased stock which would become important in building up Glengallan's flocks. In Germany Deuchar selected ten rams and ten ewes from the flocks of Baron Von Malzahn at Lenschow in Mecklenburg, of which Marshall made a further selection of ten rams and fifteen ewes in 1862, the last time that outside blood was introduced and the Glengallan Merinos were bred up from this stock.[1]\n\nBy 1865 Marshall and Deuchar had pre-empted 18,172 acres (7,354 ha), which rose to 31,166 acres (12,612 ha) by the end of 1867. This was 66% of the total run area which totalled 44,800 acres (18,100 ha), being the highest percentage of pre-empted selection of land of any run in the 1860-1874 period.[1]\n\nBy 1864 the Glengallan Head Station complex included two houses, stables and a kitchen, with new stables having been built prior to 1858. In 1866 it was described by Kate Hume, a visitor, as the house has been added to, till it resembles a village, connected by verandahs and covered ways![1]\n\nGlengallan Homestead was constructed in 1867-68, and it is thought that Deuchar had been planning his house for some time. The extant office\/store building with cellar was constructed in 1864 by local builder Donald Meiklejohn from local sandstone, and is thought to be both experimental and an integral part of the total envisaged precinct. A variety of sizes of sandstone block was used, unlike the regular masonry of the house or the irregular stonework of the verandah foundation. It has been suggested that the cellar was experimental in determining the movement and depth of the black soil, and that subsequently cellars were not chosen for the main house. It appears that the cellar was a cold store, and that the dry goods store was above, with the estate office.[1]\n\nDeuchar had intended to build a much larger house, possibly in a U-shape plan, although he only had time and resources to build one wing of Glengallan Homestead. Unconfirmed reports state that a massive hole was dug for the foundations, up to 20 feet (6.1 m) wider than the building, till sandstone was reached. On this sandstone a massive platform of basalt rubble was laid, and the outer and dividing walls were then constructed and the intervening spaces refilled to ground level. During construction the Warwick Examiner and Times noted in November 1867 that Glengallan will be one of the most splendid gentlemen's residences in the colony.[1]\n\nThe sandstone for Glengallan Homestead was quarried on the property, from an area near Swan Creek at Yangan, and the verandah sandstone, much coarser and softer, comes from Karcaruda, which was a former settlement and railway siding near Swan Creek.[1]\n\nThe construction of Glengallan was supervised by Warwick builder Thomas Wood, possibly for architect Charles Balding who, based in Ipswich, had opened a temporary office in Toowoomba and his practice extended to the Darling Downs. Balding had designed Gooloowan in Quarry Street, Ipswich, for Benjamin Cribb, which was built in 1863-64 and is noted as being similar to Glengallan. It has also been suggested that Richard George Suter (1827-1894) may have been involved, possibly taking over from Balding who left the colony in 1867. Suter later designed Jimbour House, a two-storeyed sandstone homestead built 1873-74.[1]\n\nDeuchar had two suites of furniture made at Ebenstons in Queen Street, Brisbane, for the drawing and dining rooms. The fact that local materials and a local manufacturer were used was publicised in the Brisbane Courier in August 1868. Reports of the cost of the house vary between \u00a35-12,000, and a gala opening party was held on 16 September 1868. The Deuchars hosted many social events during their time at Glengallan, and house guests included Governor Bowen and his family. Deuchar had envisaged the ground floor rooms as drawing room (north) and ball room (south), but were actually used as drawing room (south) and dining room (north) with bedrooms on the first floor.[1]\n\nNine months after the opening party, Glengallan was offered for sale. The cost of the pre-emptive purchase, building a grand house, a drought, and buying Marshall out of the partnership all contributed to Deuchar's financial ruin. In early 1865 Deuchar had taken over sole control of the management of Glengallan, and contracted to buy the property by taking out a mortgage with Marshall payable in ten years.[1]\n\nDeuchar was unable to pay instalments on the mortgage and in early 1869 Marshall agreed to Deuchar raising finance elsewhere and paying him out.[3] This did not occur and Deuchar, who also had significant other debts, sought to sell Glengallan starting in May 1869.[4] Brewster and Trebeck sought to auction the property on 7 July 1869,[5] deferred this to 21 July, but failed to attract a satisfactory bid.[6] The beginning of the end came in August when the Bank of Australasia started legal proceedings in the Queensland Supreme Court against Deuchar for the payment of an outstanding overdraft.[7] Another sale of Glengallan was proposed for 2 February 1870,[8] but this did not go ahead because Deuchar was declared bankrupt on that date.[9] At a final hearing in April 1870 Deuchar's proven debts were \u00a397,000 with \u00a380,329 owed to Marshall and \u00a315,859 to bankers.[10] The valuation of Glengallan, including all its stock, property and chattels, was \u00a380,000 so Marshall exercised his pre-emptive, and secured, rights as mortgagee and took possession of Glengallan. This included the Deuchar silver plate (much of which had been paid for by Charles in England) and other contents of the household. Deuchar retired to Mile End in Warwick where he died of pneumonia aged 50 on 11 September 1872, survived by his wife, two daughters and six sons.[1]\n\nDuring Deuchar's occupation, the servants quarters and buggy shed were built, and the gardens and avenue of trees were laid out. The house water supply and sewerage disposal system was also developed, with the water being pumped from the creek using a 2.5 horse-power Bailey engine, and the pump appears to have been set on a sandstone block platform. The water was pumped to a holding tank below the bathroom, then up to a 200-gallon lead lined wooden roof tank supplying cold water for bath, shower and flushing toilet on the first floor. The large size of the roof tank was probably due to the type of toilet system used, a rare feature at the time, which had been invented in 1778 and required high water pressure. The pump was also used to irrigate the gardens around the house.[1]\n\nDuring the next 20 years, the two early houses were demolished, and the covered way to one of the houses was truncated. A rear wing, known as the cedar wing, was built to provide guest rooms, estate office, cook's bedroom and housekeeper's room. The kitchen was built adjoining the side of the covered way, but separate from the stone house, and was set on stumps with a large chimney at its eastern end. The bath house was built against the western end of the south verandah.[1]\n\nMarshall returned in November 1870[11] and remained until 1873 when he took William Ball Slade into partnership and again retired to England where he died in August 1874. The partnership continued however, with Marshall's share transferred to his widow, Charlotte Augusta Dring Marshall, until 1904 when the property was sold.[1] Charlotte asked Slade to return the Deuchar silver plate to Eliza Deuchar in 1877.[12]\n\nA new woolshed was completed to the northwest of the house in 1873, being approximately three times the size of the present woolshed. The earliest position of the woolshed is noted in 1859-60. The 1873 woolshed is noted as having a T-shape plan and could accommodate 22 shearers, and was described in 1892 as being a hardwood structure, with a shingle roof, that could accommodate 1,000 sheep. The exact position of the washpool has been disputed, but some sources indicate that it was located upstream from the house. Clean wool was abandoned in favour of greasy wool with the cessation of sheep washing in the 1870s.[1]\n\nDuring WB Slade's time at Glengallan, many changes occurred resulting from the increased diversification of the property into dairying and crops. In the open areas fostered by the Aboriginal land management practices, prior to European settlement, a pasture dominated by nutritious grasses had developed. These grasses did not survive intensified stocking, particularly when fencing became a standard practice, and less nutritious grasses took their place. A gradual decline in the carrying capacity was noted during the period 1860-1880, and the solution was to improve the feed and as a result lucerne became a major crop.[1]\n\nFrom 1842-1868 any cultivation was limited to paddocks lower than the house and closer to the creek. After 1868, Deuchar's pump, installed to deliver water to the house, was used to irrigate nearby fields. After 1880, the benefit of lucerne as a fodder crop was recognised and the cultivation of wheat and other grains began to assume importance. For the following 80 to 90 years, many of the paddocks above and near the house were cultivated for crops, and much soil was washed away.[1]\n\n\nStud short horn bulls at Glengallan Station, 1894\nWilliam Ball Slade (1843-1938) was born in Somerset, England, and after some legal training migrated to Sydney in 1861 where his elder brother was practising as a solicitor. After pastoral experience in New South Wales and Queensland, Slade married Sophia Thompson on 1 March 1873 at St Mark's Church of England Warwick, and that year became manager and partner of Glengallan. Deuchar had established notable Shorthorn and Merino studs, and between the droughts of 1872 and 1902 Slade developed the Shorthorn stud to over one thousand pedigree females, one of the largest in the world. The Merino stud had such prestige that Slade maintained a closed flock until 1916. During that time he developed a heavier-fleeced flock, with wool that was stronger, of greater length and often brighter. He kept another line of Merinos of Vermont strain, separate from the Glengallan foundation stock, and also bred Lincolns. He exported stud Merinos to the Cape of Good Hope in 1888, a connection which was long continued.[1]\n\nMany more staff were required at Glengallan, even though shepherding was abandoned in favour of fenced paddocks, and sheep washing ceased in the 1870s. Glengallan concentrated on stud sheep and cattle, with fat lambs becoming important once rail transport and refrigeration came into the economic realm. One of Slade's achievements was to transform Glengallan from a traditional pastoral stud property to one where intensive cultivation of lucerne and other fodder supported not only the stud stock but also wethers bought for fattening from western properties, and he was praised by contemporaries as the best manager in the Darling Downs. Further diversification included dairying and a substantial piggery.[1]\n\nAt some point it appears that the main flow of Glengallan Creek became diverted down Backwater Creek, for what reason is not known. By 1892 three dams had been constructed on Glengallan Creek to provide irrigation to the paddocks. Water was still being pumped from the creek in the 1890s, but by the early 1900s water was being supplied by a bore on the northwest of Mt Marshall to a holding tank near the woolshed, and the house water system was reliant on rain water. The original timber shingles to the roof of Glengallan were sheeted over with corrugated iron and stormwater drainage was introduced. Pipes were installed at both the northwest and southwest corners of the house, with the northwest pipe feeding into the stone lined channel that runs along the west side of house with sandstone capping pieces. Pipes also fed into the roof tank.[1]\n\nIn 1885 Glengallan covered 42,000 acres (17,000 ha), and from 1896 to 1904 Glengallan was progressively broken up into smaller units. After the original leases had expired in the 1860s, lease holders were permitted to acquire large areas by pre-emptive claim and further purchases. Considerable pressures were put upon the pastoralists due to demand for smaller land holdings, eventually resulting in the Selection Acts of the 1860s and 1870s which forced them to borrow heavily, and the fluctuation of wool prices meant that it was difficult for them to make a profit. The Agricultural Lands Purchase Act of 1894 was the instrument by which many of the large estates on the Downs were broken up. Under this Act, the Glengallan partnership restored its capital and recouped drought losses in three major subdivisions between 1895 and 1904, when the partnership came to an end. Slade actively offered his property to the Government and lobbied local Members of Parliament to assist in ensuring his offer was accepted.[1]\n\nIn 1904, after the three major subdivisions, Slade retained 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) and repurchased the Glengallan Homestead block, reportedly between 1,275 and 2,000 acres (810 ha) in size, from the Government for \u00a310,265. Later in 1904, Slade transferred the Glengallan Homestead and accompanying 482 acres (195 ha) to GH Gillespie, a member of the well known firm of Victorian Millers. It appears that by 1907, Clara Gillespie was farming the Glengallan Homestead portion with her son Alexander Frederick Gillespie.[1]\n\nSlade named his smaller estate East Glengallan, built himself a residence and continued with the Glengallan Merino and Shorthorn studs. Slade acquired properties near Warwick and at Gore, towards Inglewood, for his family. In 1912 East Glengallan was subdivided with the eldest son Oswald Carey Slade (1882-1956) managing the Merino stud. Slade's other son Adrian also managed or was proprietor of award-winning studs.[1]\n\nWB Slade is celebrated as the archetypal Anglo-Australian patrician of Warwick, and was patron, office-bearer and benefactor of show societies, his church, Masonic Lodge and the Warwick branch of the Royal Society of St George. His great avocation was cricket, and he donated Slade Park to the Queensland I Zingari Cricket Club, which formed 1868 and of which he was one of the first members and Captain for almost 30 years. He established annual cricket matches at Glengallan and a pavilion was constructed. In 1932 he was appointed CBE, and he died 18 April 1938 and is buried in the Warwick cemetery. His name is remembered by the Slade School, Warwick.[1]\n\nSlade established a school, which had opened by 1886, and paid for its construction, desks, furniture and teacher. It was taken over by the Education Department in 1891, and was closed and relocated in 1904 when that portion of Glengallan was purchased by the government. Slade also gave 2 acres (0.81 ha) to the Anglican Church, and St Andrew's Church was opened in 1908. St Andrew's was described as a weatherboard church that could accommodate 200 people, painted dark red with pale green glass casement windows and a vestry at the western end. The church has since been relocated to St David's, Allora, and is attached to the hall.[1]\n\nThe only alteration made to Glengallan Homestead by Slade is thought to be the timber partition in the first floor northern room to accommodate children's bedrooms.[1]\n\nBy 1904 the structures at the head station consisted of Glengallan Homestead, with the rear cedar wing, kitchen and bath house attached, sandstone office\/store, two storeyed stables, buggy shed, and servants quarters. The garden comprised a tennis court (often used for cricket practice) to the northeast of the house, a gravel\/cobbled semi- circular drive lined by semi-circular garden beds and an extensive shrubbery, a lawn with a central circular garden, a tree lined drive (planted by Deuchar), and a box hedge separating the formal garden from the productive gardens. An orchard was located on the southern side of the house and was terraced down to Glengallan Creek which was fringed with willows. A vegetable garden was also located on the southern side or behind the house. Glengallan was described as giving the appearance of a picturesquely scattered township, and included many outbuildings and a large complex of structures nearer to the woolshed.[1]\n\nClara Gillespie was declared insolvent in July 1910, and it appears that the property was transferred to her son Alexander Frederick Gillespie in January 1912. It is noted that financial problems plagued AF Gillespie, and during his occupation of the property there appears to have been no new buildings erected and some may have begun to deteriorate. It appears that the Glengallan Homestead portion was transferred to Oswald Carey Slade (son of WB Slade) in July 1918, and AF Gillespie died in 1926-27.[1]\n\nOswald Carey Slade installed a manager, and it is recorded that the Atkinson family lived in the main house in 1927. Another manager and his family occupied the house from 1931 until he retired due to ill health in 1944-45. This was the last family to live at the house. During OC Slade's ownership, the property further deteriorated with the area between the house and the office\/store turned into a farmyard.[1]\n\nIn 1919, Glengallan was described as being approached via a winding drive over a quarter mile long, with magnificent pine trees lining either side of the drive, a neat picket fence of 270 yards (250 m) surrounds the garden area, broken by a substantial gateway of stone pillars and iron gates. It was also described as having cobbled areas to the north side of the house and approaching the office\/store doors, a fernery, small vineyard, homestead enclosure and adjacent small paddocks irrigated by pipes which were supplied by elevated tanks filled by a pump, stables with feed room and harness room, buggy shed for three vehicles, and a couple of six-room cottages for married men and their families. By this time, much of the infrastructure which originally supported Glengallan would have been disused or much modified.[1]\n\n\nLeslie centenary memorial gates, 2015\nThe two-storeyed stables burned down, probably in the late 1920s, and a stone paved and corrugated iron roofed shed was erected partly over the site. This was possibly also the site of the earlier stables as sketched by Conrad Martens in 1852, which were also possibly built on the site of the c.1842 stables. In the early 1930s the first floor of Glengallan House was unoccupied and the servants quarters, a long narrow timber building comprising rooms opening onto a verandah, was demolished. The stone pillars and iron gates were removed in 1940 to Leslie Park in Warwick where they were re-used to commemorate the centenary of the arrival of the Leslie brothers and the establishment of Canning Downs.[13][14] In 1946 the kitchen and bath house were removed to other parts of the property, and later that year the cedar wing was dismantled and sold to Eddie Mogridge of Tannymorel, and it has subsequently been moved to Swanfels. The remains of a cemetery is located at a distance from Glengallan House to the southwest, but the date of establishment is not known.[1]\n\nOswald Carey Slade was childless, and in 1931 he transferred East Glengallan to the Anglican Church, subject to a life tenancy.[1]\n\nIn 1949 Mr and Mrs OC Slade gave Glengallan Homestead to the Anglican Church. The Anglican Church had plans to dismantle Glengallan and use the materials to build a War Memorial Science Block at the Slade School in Warwick, but this did not eventuate. The school leased the property to various people for farming purposes.[1]\n\nAfter the property was accepted by the Anglican Church, no development was seriously attempted. Glengallan Homestead was left often open and used as shelter by goats and birds, and many of the fittings were removed. In 1972 the property was transferred to the Smith family. Glengallan was left unoccupied, its remaining gardens were turned into paddocks, and the slow creep of soil from cultivated paddocks above was allowed to continue. The only visible structures were the main house and the sandstone office\/store.[1]\n\nA 1975 report noted that the structure was in reasonably good condition, some sheets of corrugated iron had blown off the roof and the verandahs had deteriorated. By 1983 the southern verandah had collapsed and the eastern verandah was unstable, water was entering the building and more corrugated iron sheets were missing.[1]\n\nIn 1983, a group of fourth year architecture students from the University of Queensland made a set of measured drawings of Glengallan House. These were followed up by a conservation analysis funded by a National Estate Grant in 1983, 1984 and 1986, carried out by the Department of Architecture University of Queensland. Recommendations for the conservation and management of Glengallan were made, but no organisation was willing to undertake them. In 1993 Glengallan House and its surrounding grounds were gifted to the non-profit Glengallan Homestead Trust which was formed in 1993.[1]\n\nSince then archaeological excavations have been carried out, mainly involving the drainage, water and sewerage systems. However, works have also been carried out resulting in some damage to the property. These works include the removal of black soil overburden, the provision of water, power and telephone, the installation of a toilet block and septic system, excavation for rebuilding of verandah walls, the construction of a shed, and the verandahs have been largely removed. The roof has been repaired, with some new structural members being inserted, and resheeted with corrugated iron with some of the original timber shingles being retained in situ.[1]\n\nGlengallan Homestead is open to the public for viewing.[15]\n\nDescription\n\nWall showing ruinous state before conservation, 2015\nGlengallan Homestead is located on the southwestern slope of Mount Marshall at the mouth of a wide valley, running west from Cunningham's Gap, near the junction of the Cunningham and New England Highways approximately 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) north of Warwick. The fenced area of land on which the homestead is located is accessed via an easement from the New England Highway to the southwest. The homestead has been in a ruinous condition but is undergoing conservation works.[1]\n\nThe homestead is a long, narrow two-storeyed ashlar sandstone structure, built on an approximately north-south axis, with a hipped corrugated iron roof. The symmetrical principal elevation faces in an easterly direction overlooking the valley and towards Mount Dumaresq in the distance, which it resembles in silhouette. The rear elevation has projecting sandstone blocks on the north and south ends, indicating the intended two-storeyed extensions which were never built and which would have formed a U-shaped plan. The building originally had a timber shingled roof, and some of these shingles remain under the corrugated iron sheeting.[1]\n\nThe building has the remains of double height verandahs to the north, east and south. The most intact section of verandah is located at the northern end, with the southern end almost completely missing. The ground floor verandahs have paired, narrow ornamental cast iron columns, which were produced by the Russell Foundry of Sydney, in front and to either side of a tubular cast iron column which was intended to support the load above. These columns are currently in place only to the northern end and part of the western side, and are supported by sandstone plinths which in turn are supported by a footing wall. The paired Russell Foundry columns were also located on the first floor verandah where they acted as structural members. The inside face of the columns had timber panelling which, to the ground floor verandah, aligned with expressed false beams in the timber panelled ceiling. The ground floor columns support a timber web truss, which in turn supports the first floor verandah above. The first floor verandah had cast iron balustrades, also produced by the Russell Foundry, which have been removed.[1]\n\nThe ground floor verandahs originally had a fixed timber louvred panelled frieze, which was the remnants of a louvred system intended to have panels which ran in tracks located at the side of the columns allowing the verandah to be enclosed, but where venetian blinds were installed instead. The ground floor verandahs had timber floors which have been removed, and a central set of sandstone steps accessing the main entrance on the eastern side.[1]\n\n\nFanlights, 2015\nThe east and south walls have smooth faced sandstone blocks, while the north and west walls have picked faced sandstone. Both floors have French doors with arched fanlights opening onto the verandahs, with three sets of doors either side of the central entry, and all arched headers have expressed vermiculated keystones. The central entry has double doors with sidelights, and an arched fanlight with coloured glass segments surmounted by an expressed keystone carved in relief with the initials JD 1867 surrounded by a garland of leaves. The doors and sidelights have timber lower panels with etched, arched glazed upper panels. The French doors are similar and open inwards. Originally these doors had a second set of doors which opened outwards and contained a timber lower panel with an upper panel of copper mesh, presumably as an insect screen. The ground floor north and south elevations have a projecting sandstone bay with a central French door flanked by a tall, narrow sash window.[1]\n\nThe ground floor western wall has timber panelled doors with arched fanlight at the north and south ends. A similar doorway is located in the centre under the internal staircase, but the door is missing. These doors are accessed by rough sandstone steps and a timber ramp, and a stone lined stormwater drain is located in front of and running parallel to this wall. A tall sash window is located above the central door, with a smaller sash to either side. This symmetrical elevation has two chimney stacks which have picked-faced sandstone to the base, and smooth-faced sandstone above surmounted by a large cornice with curved capping pieces. The western wall has marks in the sandstone above the northern door which indicate the roof profile of the covered way which was originally located connected there.[1]\n\n\nDining room, 2015\nInternally, the building has a symmetrical plan with a central hall and stairwell flanked by the former dining room on the north and former drawing room on the south. The first floor has a bedroom at either end, separated from the stairwell by an ante room and linked by a short hallway. The plaster finishes are thought to be original, but have suffered much water damage.[1]\n\nAll the masonry walls are plastered, and on the first floor the non-masonry walls are lath and plaster. The ceilings are lath and plaster, and all rooms have plaster cornices, with the widths and designs varying in different rooms. Principal rooms have ornate central plaster ceiling roses, with the dining room containing two roses which would have been positioned above a central table. Throughout the building, the skirtings, architraves, doors and floor boards are cedar. Doors are panelled with etched, arched glass fanlights, and evidence of early decoration include brackets for curtain rods.[1]\n\n\nDrawing room, 2015\nThe drawing room originally had a white marble fireplace surround with relief carving of fruit, and the dining room had a black marble fireplace surround, both of which have been removed. The main bedroom, on the south, has a cedar fireplace surround and evidence of a shelving unit which was located between the chimney breast and adjacent wall but was probably not an original fitting. The adjacent ante-room housed a bathroom, and surviving evidence include vertically jointed timber panelling and a cedar surround for a shower rose. The bathroom originally housed a slate bath and flushing toilet. The northern bedroom has a vertically jointed timber partition wall which divides the room in two but which does not reach the ceiling height. This room had a cedar fireplace surround which has been removed, but the register grate is in place. The adjacent ante-room is thought to have been a nursery or dressing room.[1]\n\nThe stairwell contains a U-shaped curving cedar staircase which as been partly restored. A protective timber cover and temporary handrail has been installed, with the original turned cedar balustrade and handrail in place to the first floor landing. The stair is lit by a tall sash window.[1]\n\nTo the west of the homestead is the office\/store. This single-storeyed sandstone building has a hipped corrugated iron roof, which originally had timber shingles, and a cellar. The stonework consists of a rough alternation of thick and thin bands, and the northern elevation has a central entrance flanked by a window to either side. A second entrance is located on the eastern side facing the homestead, two windows are located on the southern side, and the cellar is entered from the west via a flight of seven sandstone steps, but the original entrance door has been removed. The building has air vents to the cellar just above ground level. Internally, this building originally had two rooms with separate entries, but the internal wall has been removed. The walls are plastered and a ceiling has been installed. Remains of cobbled paths around the building are evident.[1]\n\nCultivation of the paddocks above the homestead has resulted in the site being mantled in 300 millimetres (12 in) of black soil. Some of this overburden has been removed, but the majority of the site has been protected and the position of early structures may be able to be identified with further investigation. Excavations have been undertaken to the site of the cedar wing and kitchen complex, stables, stormwater drains and sewerage system, and to a large part of the area north and west of the office. The site boundary fence passes across the corner of the partly excavated area of the stables.[1]\n\nThe remains of the gardens include two Norfolk Island Pines appear to mark the position of the original entrance gates and stone pillars to the northeast of the homestead. The form of the raised tennis court and curved drive can be determined, and a number of mature trees are located at the northern end of the homestead. Remains of the orchard, to the south of the homestead, include a number of gnarled and twisted fruit trees.[1]\n\n\nMummified cat, 2015\nAn unexpected discovery during conservation works was the remains of a mummified cat underneath the floorboards. It is not known if the cat was accidentally entombed there or whether it was linked to medieval practice to ward off evil spirits, possibly linked to building trade guilds.[16]\n\nHeritage listing\nGlengallan Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.[1]\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\n\nThe district surrounding Glengallan Homestead was part of the area Allan Cunningham discovered and explored in 1827. The Glengallan Run was part of the first Darling Downs run, selected by Patrick Leslie in 1840, and was established and named by brothers Colin and John Campbell in 1841-42. The approximate site of the present homestead appears to have been established c.1842, and since that time has been located in a pivotal position on the main roads, which have changed slightly in position, from Toowoomba\/Drayton heading towards the south and from the Downs properties heading towards Cunningham's Gap.[1]\n\nThe homestead was built in 1867-68 by John Deuchar who, with partner Charles Henry Marshall, established the famous Glengallan Merino flock and Shorthorn stud. The breeding tradition established by Deuchar was further developed by William Ball Slade who maintained the pre-eminence of the Glengallan stud from 1873 until the property was sold in 1904. Slade also transformed Glengallan from a traditional pastoral stud property to one where intensive cultivation of lucerne and other fodder supported not only the stud stock but also wethers bought for fattening from western properties. Further diversification included dairying and a substantial piggery, and Slade was praised by his contemporaries as the best manager on the Darling Downs. Slade was also described as the archetypal Anglo-Australian patrician of Warwick, being a patron, office-bearer, benefactor and member of numerous societies, clubs, the Masonic Lodge and Anglican Church.[1]\n\nThe place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.\n\nGlengallan Homestead is a two-storeyed sandstone structure and as such, with the exception of Jimbour House, is a rare example of a Queensland homestead of that period which were mainly single-storeyed timber structures. Although the homestead was built as part of a larger, uncompleted design, the grand architectural concept can be appreciated and, with its picturesque siting, the building is recognised as a landmark in the surrounding rural landscape.[1]\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.\n\nThe site contains archaeological remains which could provide further information concerning the living conditions on the property and the development of the homestead and associated complex of buildings from the 1840s.[1]\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.\n\nThe homestead and surrounding landscape provide evidence of the way of life of a large Darling Downs Station, from its establishment to eventual decline, and the building is symbolic of the power and prestige of the Darling Downs squatters in the mid to late nineteenth century.[1]\n\nThe place is important because of its aesthetic significance.\n\nAs a ruin of a grand homestead, which has strong associations with the history and pastoral development of the Darling Downs, the building has unique aesthetic and cultural attributes and has been the subject of much community concern and recent conservation action, as reflected in its current administration by the Glengallan Homestead Trust Ltd.[1]\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.\n\nThe fabric of the building exhibits a sophisticated design approach, and the detailing of the materials reflects a fine quality of craftsmanship. Some elements of the building were technically innovative for the time, particularly the verandah louvre system and French doors with insect screens, reflecting a consideration for the Queensland climate and conditions.[1]\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nAs a ruin of a grand homestead, which has strong associations with the history and pastoral development of the Darling Downs, the building has unique aesthetic and cultural attributes and has been the subject of much community concern and recent conservation action, as reflected in its current administration by the Glengallan Homestead Trust Ltd.\n\nThe place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.\n\nThe district surrounding Glengallan Homestead was part of the area Allan Cunningham discovered and explored in 1827.

EYWORTH Aieworde, Aisseworde (xi cent.) ; Eywurth (xiii cent.). Eyworth is a small parish of 1,253J acres on the Cambridgeshire border. Its south-eastern boundary is formed by the River Rhee. The highest land is in the west of the parish, about 170 ft. above sea level, and there is a general downward slope towards the east. Of the acreage of the parish 819 J is arable land, 358 permanent grass, and 11 woods and plantations.' The soil is principally clay, the subsoil clay ; the crops are wheat, barley, peas, and beans. The village is situated in the west central part of the parish on the road from Dunton to Wrestlingworth. After enter- ing the parish from the Dunton side this road begins to descend towards the vtllage, to the south of which a branch road on the east leads down to Thistly- grounds Farm, situated in the south of the parish. At the south end of the village a short distance to the east of the road lies the Church Farm, and close to it on the north is the church of All Saints. The Manor Farm is on the west of the road, which, still descend- ing somewhat, passes on to Wrestlingworth. The houses are for the most part on the west of the road, facing a wide uninclosed green, at the south end of which, and just to the north of the church, is a rect-<\/em>\n\n<strong>Text Appearing After Image: <\/strong>\n<em>EvwoRTH Church from the South-east angular inclosure of early seventeenth-century brick- work, with small entrance doorways on the east and west, marking the site of what was evidently a build- ing of some importance.

The following thirteenth-century field names have been found :\u2014Blakechistel, Longelenecroft, Swyne- wellehul, Cattesbrayn, Donewynd, Dosshesway, Cross of Warin.' At the time of the Survey William MANORS Spec held ETWORTH MANOR, then extended at 9 hides, of the king in chief,' and it continued to be thus held until 1343,* when Ed- ward le Despenser is described as holding it of the abbot of Warden.' In 1428 the manor was held of the same overlordship,&quot; in 1451 the jurors were unable to dis- cover of whom it was held,' and finally by the attainder of Richard Carleton for treason in i486 it returned definitely to the crown.' Walter son of William Spec died without issue in 1153, and left three sisters as co-heirs, of whom Hadwisa, wife of William de Bussy,' acquired Ey- worth. Previous to 1225 her son William died, when two daughters, Cecilia and Maud, became his heirs.'&quot; Ida, daughter of Cecilia, married Robert de Vipont, and Joan, daughter of Maud, married Thomas deGravenel,&quot; and the de Viponts and the Gravenels con- tinued to hold in Ey- worth until in 1258 John son of Thomas de Gravenel finally transferred his share of the manor to Robert de Vipont, grandson of the above Robert.&quot; On his death in 1265 the manor was divided between his two daughters, Ida wife of Roger Ley- burne, and Isabel wife \u00bb7 42 Geo.

In 1334 an inquisition describes Idonea de Leyburne holding the manor of the bishop of Lincoln by service of one-tenth of a Icnight's fee, but this is probably a confusion of Eyworth and Bokland, which latter manor her hus- band held of the bishop.
